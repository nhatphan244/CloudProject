Whenever a Chatacabra enrages, it will drag its forearms through the ground to armour them with rocks, causing their arm slams to kick up debris, extending the range of these attacks. Dealing enough damage to their forearms will remove this armour and topple the monster.\nAfter performing their double arm slam, Chatacabra's tongue may be left exposed, becoming a weak point for Focus Strikes.",

This hide is made up of many small scales and has the surface quality of sandpaper, which is why it is often used to polish and sharpen human weaponry.[3] The hide of a Zamtrios regenerates constantly by growing newer, harder layers underneath itself, with the old hide eventually tearing to make way for the next layer. Thus, the defensive quality of this tissue increases as the amphibian ages.[4] The hide on the underside of Zamtrios is also extremely elastic.\nA notable feature of Zamtrios is their large dorsal fins. These tall features are used to cut through ice as the amphibian swims underneath it,[5] and are considered extremely valuable in most markets.[6]\nThe hands of Zamtrios are four fingered, with the two outer fingers being considerably shorter than those in the middle of the hand. The feet have five toes, of which the second toe is the longest, followed by the third and fourth, while the first and fifth are reduced. Each digit is connected by yellow webbing and the tail is horizontally broad and flat.\nZamtrios have pure white eyeballs with no visible irises.",

This ability is thought to have evolved out a necessity to increase the percentage of prey that can be captured in order to provide enough food for a pack up in the snowy mountains.[1] This is however a fairly rudimentary elemental attack, and Giadrome do not seem to have true Ice Sacs or equivalent organs.",

Demand and rarity drives the selling price of their hide and wings.[3]\nMost of the body of a Purple Gypceros is coloured exactly as the name would suggest, but the wing membranes are tinted a reddish-orange, and running down the sides of its neck is a line of emerald green. The end of its elastic tail shares this colour, as does the area around the Monster's eye when enraged.\nThe venom of this subspecies is more potent than that of its more obiquitous cousin, causing noxious poison in those afflicted. It also produces more of it, to a point that it will begin to salivate the substance upon becoming enraged, making pecks from its beak inflict poison as well.\nContrary to what reports may suggest, the Purple Gypceros itself isn't any more resistant to poison than a regular Gypceros.[4]",

        "behavior": "When threatened, the timid Qurupeco employs its unique ability to mimic the calls of other species of Monster to attract them, allowing it the opportunity to escape in the ensuing commotion. Depending on the size of Monster summoned, the Qurupeco will move differently during the call: when summoning smaller Monsters, such as Jaggi, Ludroth, or Melynx, it will hold its wings to the ground and head high in the air; for larger Monsters, such as Great Jaggi, Barroth, or Rathian, it will stand on one leg and swing its head right and up.\nTo replenish its stamina, a Qurupeco will feed on fish.\nMale Qurupeco use the same dancing and singing skills they display in combat to appease females during the breeding season, adding distinct sounds into their performances to differentiate its purpose.[8] Mated Qurupeco pairs warm their eggs together, and both males and females participate in parenting behaviors, taking turns between watching the nest and gathering food. Juvenile Qurupeco are born with their vocal apparatus already fully developed, and begin practicing their songs very early. This can lead to them accidentally successfully calling a dangerous predator to their nest, which the parents then counteract by imitating the calls of an even higher-ranking predator to scare the threat off again. Specific songs and dances are believed to be passed down from parents to children. The main cause of death for Qurupeco chicks is falling from the nest while practicing their dance moves. Should a parent be present during such an incident, they can catch the falling chick with their wide fan-tails, which have been theorized to have evolved for this very purpose.[7]",

A loud noise is sometimes all it takes to stop them in their tracks, reason enough to make liberal use of sonic bombs. But there's a catch: once a Yian Kut-Ku comes back to itself, it's going to be really flocking mad and come at a hunter even more viciously than before.Yian Kut-Ku are medium-sized Bird Wyverns found in tropical climates with impressively large beaks and ears. It sports vibrant pink dorsal shells that protrude outwards like spines, while its ventral scales are primarily cream. It has long legs and three-toed feet, and is known to be agile on foot. The lateral scales separating the dorsal shells from its underbelly are bright yellow. The wings of the Yian Kut-Ku have blue webbing that is incredibly resistant, making it highly valued as fusing material.[2] Its carapace is fire-resistant as well, eliminating the risk of being burnt by the fireballs it spits during combat.\nOne of the Yian Kut-Ku's most impressive features is its large ear frills, which can fold and expand at will. These frills can be used to intimidate predators by not only making the monster look bigger, but also by amplifying the sound of the Yian Kut-Ku's screeches.[3][4] When expanded, the ears resemble satellite dishes in appearance, and allow the monster's highly developed audio receptors to pinpoint the locations of both predator and prey. Its exceptional hearing also allows it to detect changes in its chicks' health by picking up on subtle differences in the calls of its young.[3] Unfortunately, the Yian Kut-Ku's sensitive ears render the monster particularly vulnerable to loud noises, such as those produced by Sonic Bombs, which can damage its ear canals and momentarily paralyze it.[3] Fully-grown Yian Kut-Ku ears are considered to be good luck charms and are often used to craft Bowguns due to their fire-resistant nature.[5][6]\nThe Yian Kut-Ku uses its large beak to dig holes in the ground in search of food, primarily insects. Its favourite prey is Konchu, and bypasses the Neopteron's tough exoskeleton by simply swallowing it whole.[7] Its beak is uniquely shaped to act as a shovel, aiding it in unearthing insects and larvae hiding underground. Holes can be seen scattered around the monster's territory as a result of it foraging.[8] While primarily insectivorous, during the breeding season, Yian Kut-Ku have been observed eating the honey from beehives.[4]",
        "behavior": "Yian Kut-Ku are typically quite skittish, but will act aggressively towards perceived threats. While considered to be weaker than other Wyverns, they are agile and enough of a threat to be considered dangerous to humans, especially since they possess a Flame Sac and are capable of spitting fireballs at enemies.\nYian Kut-Ku will occasionally reproduce en-mass when weather conditions are favourable for earthworms, one of the monster's favourite prey items, to multiply in large numbers. With an increase in the Yian Kut-Ku population, however, comes food scarcity, so the monsters seek new territory to forage for food, which eventually ends up with them attacking human settlements. In response, large-scale Yian Kut-Ku hunts are ordered to reduce the population before it spirals out of control. This ends up with a notable decline in the population's numbers, which return to normal the year following the reproduction bloom.[4]\nDuring the season of Plenty, huge flocks of Yian Kut-Ku migrate to the Scarlet Forest. This is to either find a mate or food, considering the lack of juvenile individuals.[9]",

The main difference between the two is the Blue Yian Kut-Ku's shell, which is a light blue color rather than pink. This shell is tougher than the one found on common individuals, and is resistant enough to reliably repel wyvern fangs.[2] Blue Yian Kut-Ku are also generally stronger than pink individuals, displaying greater strength and resilience especially when enraged.\nIt is currently unknown what factors caused this species to deviate from the common Yian Kut-Ku.",

        "characteristics": "Like many Brute Wyvern, Anjanath sport powerful jaws, two muscular hind legs, robust tails and short forelimbs. Their most distinct feature is that they are covered in patches of dark fur. While the Hunter's Guild calls this tissue \"Anjanath Fur\", it is in fact made up of small feathers, making the Anjanath the only currently known feathered Brute Wyvern.[3]\nThe scales of Anjanath are hard as iron and offer high defense.[4] They owe their sturdiness to being tempered by the high body temperature and flame ability of the Anjanath.[5] Very rarely, these scales can combine and overlay, turning into a valuable rolled scale plate called an Anjanath Plate.[6]\nAnjanath \"fur\" is believed to mostly aid in temperature regulation, helping the wyvern maintain the high body temperature necessary for its high level of activity.[3] This coat is however also highly defensive in nature: The feathers are thick and densely packed, providing high resistance to physical attacks.[7] Additionally, the coat is extremely fire resistant. This quality has made it a popular material for firefighter garments[8] and high quality cuts of Anjanath \"Fur\" are considered quite valuable.[9] It is believed that juvenile Anjanath possess a much larger, more developed feather coat, which then thins out as they reach maturity.[3]\nAnjanath are well-known for their distinctive pink coloration, but their skin is actually translucent. The pink hue comes from the blood flow that is visible through the skin.[3]\nAnother defining feature of Anjanath is their ability to produce and spit fire. This is achieved through a two-tiered mechanism: In their throats, Anjanath have a Flame Sac[10] which produces an flammable powder that ignites upon coming into contact with air.[11][12] Producing that powder takes time, and the Flame Sac will begin glowing through the creature's skin as it accumulates and heats the substance.[10] Simultaneously, an organ connected to the olfactory canal produces copious amounts of flammable mucus.[13] By mixing the powder and mucus in their mouths and exposing the mixture to air, Anjanath are capable of producing and spewing a destructive flame.[10]\nAnjanath are known to possess powerful bites. Their fangs are sturdy and hard, shaped by the pressure and heat inside of an Anjanath's mouth.[14] As time goes on, these fangs continually gow in size and heat resistance, eventually turning into Anjanath Hardfangs.[15]\nOne very distinctive feature of Anjanath is their nose. They have an extremely well developed olfactory sense, and can track prey by scent alone. This ability is amplified by a peculiar characteristic of Anjanath: They are able to unfurl their nostrils and expose their entire sinus structure on top of their heads. They do so by raising their nose hood, and this maneuver increases their sense of smell even further.[13] Much is still unknown about the bone structure that enables this ability, and Anjanath Nosebones are a hot research topic as a result.[16] It is believed that larger, more developed nosebones are more commonly found in more powerful Anjanath individuals.[17]\nAnjanath Tails are covered in highly flexible feathers on their top side and retractable spikes on the underside. These features can be extended at will, and when fully flexed, they allow Anjanath to create small gusts of wind by swinging their tails.[18] Anjanath tails are considered a delicacy in the regions near Kamura Village.[19]\nOn their hips, Anjanath grow a pair of extendable sail membranes. These unique structures are only visible when the wyvern is enraged, and have been found to be full of capillaries.[18] They have thus been theorized to serve as temperature regulators, potentially compensating for the Anjanath's lack of sweat glands.[20]\nThe small forearms of the Anjanath are deceptively powerful, and are used to help the wyvern with climbing up rocky cliffs.[18] Like many wyvern, Anjanath also grow valuable gems inside their bodies, formed through the continuous accumulation of impurities and marginal waste materials. Anjanath Gems are said to be tinged with fire.[21]",
        "behavior": "Anjanath are extremely aggressive, known to pursue prey for vast distances. In the New World, this even leads them to sometimes chase targets all the way from the Ancient Forest and into the Wildspire Waste. Anjanath do not seem to differentiate between minor and major threats and appear to attack with full force regardless of the situation.[1] This high degree of aggression might be linked to this species' strong food motivation - Anjanath have been observed eating as often as five times a day.[18]\nSolitary by nature, Anjanath patrol their vast territories daily, marking their borders with mucus up to thirty times each day.[18] Within these territories, Anjanath hunt alone and usually choose Aptonoth as their preferred prey. Curiously, Anjanath do not use their flame breath at all while hunting. It has been noted that this species prefers the taste of raw meat over cooked meat, so perhaps it avoids burning prey for that reason.[20]\nDue to their aggression, Anjanath often find themselves embroiled in territorial disputes with other monsters. During such skirmishes, Anjanath extend their sails, tail feathers and nostrils[18] and focus on inflicting physical damage first. Using their powerful bodies, Anjanath brutally assault their enemies. Anjanath are actually quite calculated fighters, as their brutish barrage serves mainly to wear down their enemies and buy time for the wyvern's flame sac to charge up.[10] Once ready, the Anjanath enter into a fired-up state, where the flame sac in their throats glows menacingly. Anjanath then move in for the final blow, attempting to overwhelm the opponent with devastating flame attacks. This state is powerful, but usually shortlived: Keeping the flame sac active appears to be quite exhausting for the Anjanath. Additionally, hunters have occassionally witnessed the flame in an Anjnath's mouth detonating inside of it, harming the creature - likely a risk inherent to the use of this ability. Due to these factors, Anjanath try to finish opponents off quickly once they become fired up, releasing all their stored up mucus and flame powder into one devastating fire blast once they notice that their time is up. Due to these difficulties and the fact that it remains entirely unused during regular hunting, it has been theorized that the Anjanath's flame breath evolved specifically as a last resort weapon against opposing large monsters.[10]\nWhen not in combat, Anjanath have been observed sunbathing in the Ancient Forest. Why exactly they do this is unclear, but Anjanath are known to seek out the opportunity to sit in the sun at least three times a day.[3] Very little is known about the social behavior between Anjanath, but the sails have been proposed as a possible means of communication between individuals.[18]",

A similar structure is formed by the horn on the scalp, while the tail ends in a club-like structure. The individual plates of shell that form the outer part of a Brachydios's armor are sharply pointed at the ends, and form long spikes on the legs, forearms, neck, and skull, where a set of particularly broad and robust spikes form a crest at the back.\nThe thick slime that secretes from the Brute Wyvern's scalp and covers much of its body is believed to be a species of silme mold, which has a volatile reaction with the contents of its saliva and is produced in the horn even after death.[4] When striking the ground with its horn or forearms, a Brachydios will leave behind a puddle of this explosive slime, which will begin changing colour from green to red before exploding; when enraged, the puddle explodes immediately, and the slime covering its body will glow yellow and orange.",

        "characteristics": "Due to its enhanced metabolism, Deviljho must constantly seek out prey. It is extremely violent, and known to snatch up large monsters in its powerful maw and flail them around.Deviljho is a large, bipedal brute-wyvern with a body similar to a T-Rex, but with its own unique physiology. Its body is covered in dark green scales. They have compact, bulbous bodies. A line of spikes runs down its back. Its body is held up by powerful legs. The feet have three clawed toes that touch the ground and another that hangs on the side. The tiny forearms end in two fingers. The tail is large and meaty. Spikes run down both the tail's top and bottom with two more lines on each side. The neck is thick. It holds the head below the level of the back. \nThe head is large and the yellow eyes are small. Unlike most Brute Wyverns, Deviljho lacks any horns or crest on its head. Instead, it has very robust jaws. The jaw adductor muscles are bright pink and well-developed. The area behind the adductor muscles lacks scales, this gives the illusion that Devoljho's mouth continues into the neck. Rows of razor-sharp teeth line both the inside and outside of the mouth. Devljho continuously grows more teeth throughout its life. It will rub its mouth on the ground to remove teeth that are old or damaged[4].\nDeviljho's muscles are extremely large and dense, giving them terrifying strength. Deviljho are easily capable of breaking through fallen trees[5] and launching boulders. They can even lift other large monsters such as Diablos over its head.[6] Deviljho also have a faster metabolism than other wyverns, allowing them to be active for longer periods.[2] Due to its fast metabolism and large muscles, Deviljho is almost always hungry[2]. Its hunger causes its mouth to constantly drool. A Deviljho's saliva is highly acidic, melting through scale and bone alike. It deteriorates the armor of hunters just as easily.[4]\nWhen enraged, adrenaline causes a Deviljho's body goes into overdrive. Blood flow increases. The muscles swell to be even larger and glow blood red. The most notable effect is that Deviljho will begin to produce dragon energy. It will breathe streams of Dragon Element vapor upon its opponents. There is a cost to this additional power. The swelling causes the skin to tear, reopening old wounds.[7]\nDeviljho are highly adaptable, they can appear in seemingly any habitat. Hot, cold, dry, humid, hazardous, or peaceful. If there is a lot of prey available, Deviljho will appear.\nDeviljho of the New World differ from those of the Old World. Deviljho of the New World are generally more muscular, especially in the head and neck. However, their chest are leaner. The reason for this increased muscle mass is unknown. It may be related to the tendency of New World individuals to carry large prey in its jaws.[8]",
        "behavior": "Deviljho are only driven by their insatiable hunger. They endlessly wander looking for more prey. This prey could be small herbivores, large wyverns, Elder Dragons, or even its own kind. Deviljho will pursue them indiscriminately. Deviljho uses its strong sense of smell to search for food. Smaller prey is swallowed whole immediately. Larger prey has to be torn apart before consumption.[2]\nDeviljho are Invaders. They will enter any habitat and disrupt the balance of its ecosystem by predating on too many monsters. Some individuals in the Old World have caused an ecosystem to collapse.[2] Deviljho have been observed to specifically hunt the apex monsters ruling the location they invade. For Flying Wyverns, Deviljho will ambush them, seizing them in its jaws before they can take flight. On the rare occasion when a Deviljho is not hungry, it may still attack a smaller monster for seemingly no reason. Deviljho's violent nature has earned it many names such as \"Gluttonous Demon\"[9] and \"World Eater.\"[10]\nDeviljho chiefly rely on their jaw to subdue opponents. They will bite opponents like most Brute Wyverns do but also have other attacks that are uniquely reckless. A common attack is when the monster raises its body and opens its mouth. Then it will slam its teeth down on the opponent. Another is to shove its lower jaw into the ground and then advance toward the opponent in an attempt to scoop it into its maw. Deviljho will also lunge at its prey, though with significantly less grace than other monsters. They will also swing their huge bodies, stomp the ground to cause tremors, and launch boulders at their opponent. When enraged, Deviljho puts even more force into each attack. It also gains the ability to spew clouds of Dragon Energy out of its mouth. \nOnce a Deviljho's prey is firmly in its maw, it will throttle its prey and slam it on the ground. Regardless of whether the prey dies or not, the Deviljho may walk around with its meal still in its jaws. If it spots another potential prey item, the Deviljho will forget it already has a meal in its mouth and pursue the new target. It will use the creature in its mouth as a brutal weapon. Deviljho will slam its new prey with its old prey, causing significant damage to both.[4][11]",
        "useful_information": "Useful Information: When enraged, Deviljho's swollen muscles glow a hellish red. It will start spewing a sweeping dragon element attack, so watch your distance.

Its forelimbs have been adapted into purple raptorial structures used to pierce the vitals of prey,[2] while its hind limbs end in three digits resembling purple suction cups. The monster's entire body is covered in a saggy, mottled indigo hide with spots of teal and purple throughout. This hide is extremely elastic and can stretch to several times its normal size,[3] but always returns to its original shape afterwards.[4] The spotted patterns on a Rompopolo's hide are said to indicate how poisonous it is.[5]\nRompopolo produce gases within their bodies, which they pump into saggy sacs on their head, torso, and tail, causing them to dramatically inflate. The sacs on the anterior half of its body are filled with poison gas that the monster expels from a hole in its whip-like tongue, while the posterior sacs contain pressurized gas which is injected into the ground using the stinger on its abdomen, creating violent explosions when the gas bubbles to the surface.[6]",

Since they rely on their tails to attack from a distance as well as to start blazes, a hunter can weaken this monster significantly by cutting it off.Quematrice are relatively small for a Brute Wyvern. The Quematrice's scales are grey in color with blue mottling. They have short, robust skulls and strong jaws. The eyes are midway between the front and back of the skull.[2] The eyes have a golden color. The pupils are slit. Quematrice possesses a nictitating membrane that can be briefly seen when it blinks. Interestingly, the teeth are similar to a canine's. On the lower jaw, there are three pairs of small incisors in the front, a pair of very stout canines, and four pairs of carnassials in the back. The outer two incisors and canines in the lower jaw stick out of the mouth when it is closed, there is a kink in the upper jaw that the canines fit into. The teeth in the upper jaw have a similar arrangement, though the upper canines are much smaller.[2] There is a bright red comb on top of its head, similar to a rooster's. Two more crests surround each eye and project backwards. They resemble a reddish-orange mask. All three crests naturally have holes in them.\nThe sides of the neck have two large dewlaps. The dewlaps are grey with red spots and dark blue at the fringes. The torso region is round like a barrel. The arms are short and somewhat pudgy. The hands are small with three short fingers on each. The legs are also short but muscular, especially the thighs. There are four toes on each foot. The innermost toe is vestigial. The tail of Quematrice is very long and muscular. It is lined with long tasseled frills called \"pleats.\"[3] These pleats make Quematrice look significantly larger. Where they attach to the tail, the pleats are grey, moving outwards, they are dark blue and then red near the fringe.\nThe tail contains a flammable fluid, Quematrice Igniter. When it swings its tail, Quematrice can release this fluid as a grey gas. The pleats of its tail rubbing together create sparks that ignite the gas.[4] The gas will burn for a single second before dissipating. Severing a Quematrice's tail makes it difficult to create sparks.\nThe scales of a Quematrice have a sharp, fine edge. It can be used to polish armor or cut into stone.[5][6] This sharpness is possibly why they create sparks. Its scales and hide are very heat-resistant.[7]",
        "behavior": "Quematrice primarily inhabit the savanna area of the Windward Plains, where large groups of the local herbivores gather. It may enter more barren areas if chased off by another monster, but it will soon return. They rest inside large cut-out areas of cliffsides. They can also be found in the Ruins of Wyveria.\nQuematrice is chiefly a scavenger. It feeds off of animals that have already died, usually by other carnivores.  Instead of waiting, Quematrice will seize food from smaller predators, be it Talioth or Felynes delivering meat[8]. The formal are hostile towards the Brute Wyvern for this reason. There are many larger predators that are a danger to Quematrice. These include Rathian, Doshaguma packs, and Rey Dau during the Sandtide.  The comb also serves as a decoy for predators to attack instead of the head itself.[9] The Brute Wyvern may fight back against these predators, but will quickly retreat once it sustains enough damage.\nQuematrice fights with its head and tail. It will bite with its strong jaws or \"peck\" with the front of its snout. Its large tail can be used to sweep away or smash opponents. The tail can spread a flammable gas. The gas will then be ignited by sparks made when the tail is swung again. This creates a ring of fire and a subsequent circle of burnt grass around Quematrice.\nWhen not competing with other predators, Quematrice is relatively docile. It ignores all living herbivores and hunters that stay at a moderate distance. A monster that they will not tolerate is another Quematrice. When two individuals see each other, they will immediately engage in a brief territorial battle. The one who is knocked over first will retreat. Quematrice will shake the bright comb on its head to display its aggression toward opponents.[10]",

A Nu Udra's soft body allows them to slip through crevasses and move in surprising ways, so be careful not to let them get the jump on you.Nu Udra primarily attacks with physical strikes from its six grounded arms, being able to launch attacks in nearly any direction and strike with multiple arms at once. The glowing sensory organs on the tips of their arms provide hunters with an idea of who is currently being targeted by which arm. Each arm can be individually severed to reduce their range and provide extra carves.\nOnce enraged, Nu Udra's body begins glowing as they ignites it on fire and begin to use more powerful fire-based attacks. This includes flaming oil projectiles that create delayed explosions on impact and using its siphon to expel large amounts of fire on the ground. Eventually, Nu Udra will shed its oil coating in a dense rain of flaming oil, reappling its oil coat afterwards.

But watch out when they get angry and burst into flame. You can douse any parts that are burning with watermoss - a recommended strategy, since it will leave the monster weakened. A Nu Udra's soft body allows them to slip through crevasses and move in surprising ways, so be careful not to let them get the jump on you.Nu Udra is an enormous monster with a strong resemblance to octopuses. It has a striped teal, purple, and black hide that becomes more yellow towards the ends of its tentacles, but is usually found completely coated in a tar-like \"oilmucus\" produced as a combination of its naturally flammable mucus and surrounding oilsilt,[2] the former of which is produced from a siphon beneath its mantle. Like a real-world octopus, it bears a total of eight tentacles; six larger arms used for locomotion and offense, and two smaller ones that conceal its beak like an upper lip. Each of the six main tentacles has rows of spines running along them\u2014said spines also cover Nu Udra's mantle\u2014a blue eye-like sensory organ on each end, and numerous large spikes lining their bottom side. Another pair of these sensory organs can be found on the head, where they can easily be mistaken for actual eyes. Above them are a pair of horn-like protrusions that protect its \"eyes\", giving the monster a demonic appearance. When enraged, its sensory organs, horns, and upper body glow bright blue.\nNu Udra has the ability to spontaneously ignite the fluid it produces, allowing it to emit massive deluges of fire towards enemies by pumping flaming mucus towards them, engulf itself in flames once enraged, or throw globs of explosive oilmucus with its tentacles. The flames it ignites are extremely hot and burn for a prolonged period of time,[3] while Nu Udra suffers no ill effects due to its fireproof hide.[4] Its tentacles are extremely muscular despite their flexibility, with each one being strong enough to lift a large monster like Ajarakan with no visible exertion; it uses them to grapple and bludgeon enemies or prey while gouging them with the numerous twisted spikes lining them.[5]\nBecause its body is soft and boneless barring its beak and spines, Nu Udra is able to fit its whole body into extremely small openings, which it uses to traverse its environment by squeezing through crevices and tunnels.",
        "behavior": "Nu Udra is highly aggressive towards intruders in its territory, but seems to seldom venture out of it, as it had not been sighted in many decades when it was rediscovered by Azuz and the Guild. It is seemingly attracted to sources of heat and fire, and is noted to become more aggressive in their presence. It appears to be a fairly intelligent monster, making full use of its dexterous tentacles and soft body for both defense and offense.\nNu Udra, unlike many other monsters, sleep in tight cavernous pits, blocking off almost all access to its den. It pokes one tentacle out of the hole however, as a way to sense incoming intruders in its territory.\nNu Udra primarily hunts during the Firespring, the Inclemency of the Oilwell Basin.",

The mucus secreted from their tentacles hardens quickly into sharp edges that resemble blades or spears, which is why some call Xu Wu the \"Piercing Assassin\". The sizable mouth hidden on their underside allows them to devour even rather large prey.\nHelpful Hints: Due to their predatory nature, you can expect Xu Wu to attack Guardians inside their habitat. They have no eyes, but their other senses are developed and they excel at catching prey off guard, especially with their ability to enter small crevices and crawl quickly across the ground. When one exposes its mouth, that means a deadly attack is coming, but with a powerful blow, you might be able to topple the creature.Xu Wu attacks almost exclusively with their arms, using their mucus to form golden blades on the limb they are about to attacks with. They are also capable of throwing these blade-like secretions as projectiles. While their front arms can only be broken, their middle and back arms can be severed to reduce their range.\nOccaisonally, Xu Wu will rear up, exposing the mouth on their underside before lunging forward at their target. If the monster is flinched while preparing to lunge, they will enter a special toppled state where their mouth is exposed. This will also occur when a hunter hits Xu Wu's mouth with Slinger ammo if it grabs and attempts to devour them.\nWhile in their nest in Area 12, Xu Wu are capable of burrowing into the ground in order to reposition, including to emerge from the ceiling into an immediate lunge with their mouth.\nAs it does not rely on sight to detect prey, it is immune to Flash Bombs and similar effects.",

When one exposes its mouth, that means a deadly attack is coming, but with a powerful blow, you might be able to topple the creature.Xu Wu is a medium sized Cephalopod that shares the general body shape of its class, with six thin but muscular tentacles used for locomotion and two smaller ones on the front of its body. Its head is large, rocky, and mushroom-shaped, with several teeth on the top, and a small, saggy mantle hanging off the back. Beneath its mantle is a \"false face\" resembling a set of teeth with grey fibers resembling a beard; the former will glow blue and start emitting vapor when Xu Wu is enraged. Its body and tentacles are highly fibrous in texture, and are primarily black with golden highlights. Its body underneath its tentacles is bright blue and lined with many rows of sharp teeth, with a large mouth directly beneath its head. Its mouth and fangs can crush nearly any prey,[2] and can devour prey larger than one would expect it to be able to.\nXu Wu's tentacles secrete a golden mucus that quickly hardens on contact with air, creating crystalline structures on its tentacle tips that it uses to hunt.[3] It is able to create sharp blades that can swiftly pierce and slash prey, crystal clusters that it can break off and launch as knife-like shrapnel, and hooks that it can use to immobilize prey or drag itself around terrain. These crystals are extremely hard despite their brittle appearance, but appear to be short-lived, as the weapons dissolve shortly after being created.\nXu Wu does not have eyes, but its other senses are highly developed to compensate.",
        "behavior": "Xu Wu is an apex predator that primarily uses its maneuverability to take its prey off guard with surprise attacks that kill without a sound,[4] particularly its ability to squeeze through the small spaces of its habitat. If forced into combat, Xu Wu will use its agility to outmaneuver a target, leaping and slithering around them while striking them with a flurry of precise piercing and slashing blows from its formed weapons, then crushing them within its maw.\nIt is adapted to prey on the Guardians of the Ruins of Wyveria, and is attracted to Guardians, their cocoons, or anything made to resemble them,[5] although it will also attempt to prey on anything else that enters the Ruins, even humans. Although it uses its ambush tactics against the Guardians, it is able to dominate them in direct combat as well, as its hide can easily repel their attacks,[6] and it has been seen rather easily bringing them down with its tentacles before moving in to devour them.[7]\nXu Wu is most active during the Wyvern's Wakening, the Inclemency of the Ruins of Wyveria, where it emerges to prey on the increased number of awakened Guardians.",

The crystals formed by their attacks will explode from elemental interference, making Slinger ammo effective.Guardian Arkveld closely resembles its original variant, but is slightly more pale in coloration, along with having the signature glowing purple veins of the Guardians distributed along its body, most prominently its head and chains.\nSimilar to the other Guardians, Guardian Arkveld is unable to reproduce and has no need to predate, feeding exclusively on Wyvern Milk. However, due to retaining parts of the unique physiology and energy absorption abilities of the Arkveld species, it is capable of additionally absorbing elemental energy for sustenance.[3] This notably allowed it to regain parts of its original physiology and instincts by absorbing energy from other monsters, such as its predatory drive and reproductive capabilities. However, it appears still unable to properly digest solid food.",
        "behavior": "Originally the only one of its kind created to serve Wyveria, Guardian Arkveld managed to reawaken and break free after being put into stasis, escaping the Ruins of Wyveria and starting to hunt other monsters. By aggressively targeting and draining the largest sources of energy, it was able to partially regain its nature as a Flying Wyvern, such as its drive to predate and ability to lay eggs. However, it was unable to control its intake of Wyvern Milk after learning feeding behavior, upon which the excess energy intake from feeding caused it to descend into a berserk frenzy where it slaughtered and attempted to devour every monster in its vicinity, despite seemingly being unable to ingest the food. The Avis Unit was forced to put it down to prevent it from decimating the ecosystem.\nIt is unknown how Guardian Arkveld behaved prior to its reawakening.",

Guardian Doshaguma cannot reproduce and do not require food, relying instead on Wyvern Milk for energy. While anything but agile, they're tough enough to charge right through attacks without flinching, making them extremely dangerous. Most Guardian Doshaguma attacks are big forelimb swings. While not agile, the attacks that carry Guardian energy will cause wide explosions. Watch out for the acid in their saliva, which temporarily lowers defense. By dealing with their forearm attacks properly, you can expose a weak point worth exploiting.

        "hunter_notes": "An artificial monster species created by an ancient civilization and imbued with Rathalos's power. Guardian Rathalos cannot reproduce and do not require food, relying instead on Wyvern Milk for energy. Just like the original Rathalos, they are superior fliers and will attack more violently with their claws while airborne.Helpful Hints: The unique Guardian energy from Guardian Rathalos's claw attacks is explosive and dangerous. This energy will cause wyvern milk on the ground to crystalize, and if these crystals are hit by the monster's fire attacks it will cause an explosion of the same element. Given that they are triggered by elemental interference, Slinger ammo could be used effectively against them.Much like its base counterpart, Guardian Rathalos primarily attacks with their poisonous talons and their flaming breath, though they are more adept at attacking with their talons from the ground.\nMost attacks performed with Guardian Rathalos's talons will cause bursts of Wylk to occur, signalled by their legs glowing white beforehand. When these attacks are performed on pools of Wylk, they will leave behind a Wylkrystal. Hitting a Wylkrystal with any form of elemental attack will cause it to explode, dealing damage corresponding to that element. However, Guardian Rathalos' fire attacks can also cause the Wylkrystals to explode.\nLike all Guardians, Guardian Rathalos are capable of regenerating any wounds inflicted upon them.

This energy will cause wyvern milk on the ground to crystalize, and if these crystals are hit by the monster's fire attacks it will cause an explosion of the same element.

        "hunter_notes": "A massive Guardian that has been feeding off the Dragontorch's energy. Its body is encased in crystallized Wyvern Milk, allowing it to regenerate. Zoh Shia, like other Guardians, excels at energy attacks and can produce repeated explosions to crystallize the whole area. Beneath its white Guardian coat, its body pulses with dark recollection - which you may see, should it reveal its full power from the days of yore.Helpful Hints: Zoh Shia share the same basic traits of other Guardians. The crystals on their wings and head can be stripped away to deplete their energy stores. The white crystals on their bodies will grow back weaker, making them easier to destroy a second time. The crystals they create will detonate if they take elemental damage, but a talented hunter can use elemental Slinger ammo and smart maneuvering to make good use of them.Zoh Shia has three distinct phases that it progresses through as it loses health. Unlike all other Constructs, Zoh Shia is immune to traps, and also cannot be affected by Flashes.\nIn the first phase, its body will be completely covered by armor that makes it more resilient and renders it immune to Wounding, which can be broken to deal more damage to the monster. Any broken armor parts will regenerate after some time has passed, although they will be significantly easier to break after regrowing. Zoh Shia primarily uses physical blows from its wingarms, and infuses the ground with energy explosions that create Wylkrystals, which can be detonated with its elemental attacks. Hunters can detonate these Wylkrystals with elemental Slinger ammo, such as the Thundercryst and Wyrmsbane lying around the map, dealing damage to Zoh Shia if it is close enough. The explosion of the Wylkcrystals can also cause a chain reaction with other nearby Wylkcrystals, dealing even more damage to the monster and knocking it down if enough hit it at once. Dealing enough damage will cause it to reveal its head, which will use fireball and fire breath attacks while exposed. The head can still grow back its armor, but will be forced to shed it when breathing fire.\nHanging above the area are 2 Shrine Fragments, which can be dropped onto Zoh Shia using the hook slinger and knock the monster down.\nIn the second phase, Zoh Shia will fly into the air before losing the armor on its wings. After creating a large number of massive Wylkrystals, it ignites the ceiling, causing fireballs to rain down across the area and periodically fall for the rest of the fight. It then breathes a torrent of fire that drastically intensifies after a short delay and ignites all the Wylkrystals to expand its reach. Hunters can detonate the Wylkrystals early with elemental Slinger ammo to prevent Zoh Shia from using them to spread its flames. In this phase, Zoh Shia is still able to use Wylk attacks, but liberally uses a wider array of fire attacks, including jets of flame that leap along the ground. It is also able to use a smaller-scale version of its phase transition nova later in the phase, but this one can additionally be avoided by moving behind Zoh Shia.\nIn the third phase, Zoh Shia completely sheds its armor and loses the ability to grow it back, showing its true form and gaining the ability to use red lightning attacks. It will begin the phase by creating a large number of Wylkrystals and summoning a barrage of lightning from above, detonating the crystals. It continues to use all attacks from the previous phases in combination with its new lightning attacks, while also reusing its phase transition attack when it is at low health.\nAfter its double wingarm slam while its arms are exposed, Zoh Shia's hands become weak points for Focus Strikes.",

        "characteristics": "Hunters Notes: A massive Guardian that has been feeding off the Dragontorch's energy. Its body is encased in crystallized Wyvern Milk, allowing it to regenerate. Zoh Shia, like other Guardians, excels at energy attacks and can produce repeated explosions to crystallize the whole area. Beneath its white Guardian coat, its body pulses with dark recollection - which you may see, should it reveal its full power from the days of yore.Helpful Hints: Zoh Shia share the same basic traits of other Guardians.

The crystals they create will detonate if they take elemental damage, but a talented hunter can use elemental Slinger ammo and smart maneuvering to make good use of them.Zoh Shia is an enormous monster with traits similar to that of Elder Dragons. It has a slender, quadrupedal frame, with two massive wingarms growing from its back. Its entire body is covered in a coiled, layered shell of crystallized Wyvern Milk, with numerous crystal protrusions resembling flower petals or feathers sprouting from all over, most prominently on its wingarms. Its head is ovoid in shape and somewhat beak-like, lacks eyes, and boasts a frill of wedge-like spikes lining it, with two more prominent spikes at the top in the place of horns. Its claws are elongated by uniform Wylk growths and are distinctly stake-like,[3] while its tail is long and thin, resembling a whip. Its flesh beneath the armor is an unnatural purple, visible when it opens its almost toothless mouth, or in the palms of its wingarms. Should its face plate be broken, a single black eye or eye-hole can be seen beneath the surface.\nIts crystal Wylk shell not only continuously regenerates from damage, but stores large amounts of energy that Zoh Shia discharges from its wingarms to defend itself, infusing the ground with energy and creating large explosions that crystallize the surroundings into more Wylkrystals. The crystals on the shell have even been observed growing after they have been removed from the monster.[4] In spite of this, the shell is noted to constrict Zoh Shia as much as it protects it.[5]\nAs Zoh Shia is damaged, it will slowly shed parts of its shell and reveal its true body, a hideously deformed dragon-like monster seemingly made of an amorphous, wax-like black substance; this \"Blackember Mass\" can reform and transform freely, allowing Zoh Shia to fit into its original shell and regrow it if needed, and constantly pulses in an alien manner.[6] Its head becomes an asymmetrical tangle of large twisted horns that cover its yellow reptilian eyes, with its mouth becoming more toothy and exposing an elongated, serpentine tongue. Its wingarms expand in size and begin growing horn-like protrusions all over them as well, while the glowing purple parts on their undersides begin to glow bright red when the monster is further angered. All of the feathery spikes along its body are also revealed to be more traditional and draconic in appearance, same with its claws. As the monster continues to shed its shell and enrage, the horn-like growths all over its body will continue to grow larger and more malformed.\nIn its true form, while Zoh Shia retains its Wylk explosions, it also gains the ability to breathe fire from its mouth and emit it from the palms of its wingarms. When the monster is angered enough, it will also begin emitting red lightning, both from its body and summoned from its surroundings.\nHidden within Zoh Shia's body is an elaborate, inorganic gem that seems to have something wriggling within.[7]\nAs a Guardian, Zoh Shia does not need to eat or reproduce, able to subsist solely on Wyvern Milk. However, due to an unknown mechanism, it is able to reproduce through fragmentation, where not only can Zoh Shia continue to regenerate and come back to life provided enough energy and time, every fragment separated from Zoh Shia has the potential to grow into an entirely new Zoh Shia. These fragments take on a black liquid form contained in flowery cocoons as they grow, but Zoh Shia itself is able to break the cocoons and absorb the liquid within for an unknown purpose.",
        "behavior": "Little is known about Zoh Shia's original behavior due to the length of time that passed between its awakening and recent rediscovery. It can be presumed to be a destructive monster that wiped out a civilization, although it's unknown if that is due to its natural instincts or pre-programmed ones. Following that, it took up residence in the Dragontorch Shrine and absorbed energy for an unknown reason (speculated to be some kind of metamorphosis), reacting violently when suddenly reawakened.",

In this state, Gore attacks primarily using their wing-arms, as well as using frenzy-based explosions. Gore Magala is permenantly enraged while in the Frenzy State and will cause anyone fully infected with the Frenzy virus to take passive damage overtime.

Target the head to put a stop to Gore Magala\u2019s Frenzy.Gore Magala are extremely unusual creatures. Their body plan resembles that of many Elder Dragons: Six limbs - two of which are modified into large wings -, a long and flexible tail and a horned head. Their bodies are covered entirely with a thick black shell, composed of countless overlapping scales. The massive wing-arms are muscular and sport clawed hands with opposable thumbs. The wing membranes are covered in tiny hairs, which fall off and regenerate continually. This constant stream of particles gives the Gore Magala's wings the appearance of being cloaked in smoke.\nThe scales of Gore Magala are pitch black, with their dark outer layer being the result of cornification.[4] They are considered to be so deeply black that they are described as devouring light rather than reflecting it.[5] These properties have granted these scales various reputations, as they are considered bringers of ill fortune by some,[6] while others see them as bewitching and alluring.[7] These scales overlap and reinforce eachother into an armor shell, which protects the monster from harm. Gore Magala shells are considered quite resilient, and are said to harm the flesh of weaker attackers on contact.[8] Harder sections of the shell may be called either Carapace or Cortex, the latter of which has been rumored to induce insanity when worn as part of crafted armor.[9][10]\nOne of the most crucial characteristics of the Gore Magala is that they are blind. They possess no visible eyes and seem to have no traditional visual sense. They instead rely on an entirely unique sensory mechanism centralized around its wings. The wing membranes of Gore Magala produce innumerable tiny hairs, which detach from the membrane surface continually. Once detached, these hair particles saturate the air and spread to nearby surfaces. Gore Magala posses a pair of horns that usually remain folded backwards. These structures - sometimes also called Feelers[11] or Sensors[12] - have the peculiar ability to sense the presence of anything that is covered in the Gore Magala's scales.[13] By spreading this black dander, Gore Magala can therefore enhance their ability to sense their surroundings, making up for their seeming blindness.[14] The sensory acuity of the Gore Magala increases proportionally to the amount of dander that they have been able to expel.[15]\nThe dander of Gore Magala also serves another purpose however. These tiny particles are the primary vectors that spread the Frenzy Virus (\u72c2\u7adc\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9, \"mad dragon virus\"), a mysterious condition that causes affected monsters to become violent and aggressive. It is called a \"Virus\" due to its ability to spread from one victim to the next, resembling a viral disease.[13] The disease takes effect when the dander is inhaled, but open wounds can also accelerate infection.[16] The presence on the Frenzy Virus also affects the bodies of Gore Magala. Accumulated clumps of the virus can crystalize into Frenzy Shards, which the Hunter's Guild treats as highly dangerous items that must be turned in.[17] Some of the scales on Gore Magala also absorb the Frenzy Virus over time, becoming empowered enough to earn a new name - Defiled Scales.[18] One scale on the monster's body can be pushed even further beyond, imbued with unbelievable power and called Gore Magala Mantle by the Guild.[19]\nThe muscular wing arms of Gore Magala are well-developed and covered in highly resistant plating. Some of these armor plates are considered quite valuable, named Gore Magala Plates by the Guild.[20] The claws of the wing arms are razor sharp and can cut through living tissue with ease.[21] These claws are also capable of directly causing Frenzy Virus infection in those they slash.[22] It has long since been rumored among artisans that even after these claws have been removed from Gore Magala, they can still cause various afflictions in those that touch them.[23] Curiously, this fear of infection among craftsmen predates the official discovery of the Frenzy Virus.[16]\nGore Magala wings appear to be constantly writhing due to the endless stream of dander flowing off from them. Fragments of the membrane that have been torn off continue to move and writhe even after they have been separated from the body.[24] Due to their role in spreading the Frenzy Virus, it is said that the mere shadow of these wings can cause insanity in those it covers[25] and the full shape of the creature's wings is sometimes called a Gore Magala Eclipse.[26]\nGore Magala's Horns usually remain hidden by being folded into the head, as the creature has adapted to protecting its valuable sensory organs from damage. When the dander saturation in the area around the Gore Magala reaches its apex however, the horns will spring outwards and reveal themselves to take in as much sensory data as possible.[27] When extended, the tips of the horns will glow in a foreboding purple, as they are absolutely doused in Frenzy Virus.[28] Due to the high risk of infection, these horns were at one point considered \"Forbidden Spoils\" by the Guild.[29]\nGore Magala have flexible and whip-like tails that can be used as devastating weapons. Their high destructive power comes from the many reverse scales that grow on them,[30] which allow tail swipes to shred prey apart violently.[31]\nVarious mysterious things grow within the bodies of Gore Magala. Hunter's sometimes retrieve a growth called a Nyctgem from them, which is said to imprison and destroy light itself.[32]",
        "behavior": "Very little is known about Gore Magala behavior. It can often be observed twitching and convulsing, as if it is writhing in pain. The intensity of this behavior has been suggested to be an indicator of its imminent transition into adulthood. It generally seems to roam the lands spreading its Frenzy Virus far and wide. As the amount of frenzy particles increases, the underside of the wings of Gore Magala begin to glow in various colors, transition from blue to purple. Past a certain point, the creature alights with frenzy, extends its horns and wails loudly, entering a condition called the Frenzied State. This ability enhances the monster's abilities temporarily, but wears off if the horns are damaged enough. It has been theorized that this behavior results from Gore Magala temporarily giving in to the Frenzy Virus. Due to these behaviors, Gore Magala appear in ancient legends as Demons of Disease and Death.[16]",

        "hunter_notes": "Alatreon is capable of utilizing Fire, Water, Thunder and Ice elemental attacks, along with physical attacks imbued with Dragon element. Alatreon's water attacks leave behind pools of water than can be ignited with fire attacks, causing damage over time to hunters standing on them. Alatreon's ice attacks leave behind ice shards that explode when struck by thunder.\nAlatreon has three \"active\" states that determine its elemental weaknesses and elemental usage. In its orange Fire Active state, it is weak to Ice and Water, resistant to all other elements, and can utilize Fire. In the blue Ice Active state, it is instead weak to Fire and Thunder, and can utilize Ice. In the purple Dragon Active state, it can use all its elements, becomes moderately vulnerable to all elements, and becomes particularly vulnerable to Dragon. Alatreon only utilizes thunder while grounded and water while flying.\nAfter some time in each Element Active mode, Alatreon will proceed to fly in the air. In Fire/Dragon Active mode, Alatreon will launch a fireball to propel itself off the ground, while in Ice/Dragon Active mode, Alatreon breathes ice into the sky, creating icicles that can drop down from above, similar to Velkhana. Unless the hunter uses a flinch shot mid-air while Alatreon is not enraged, it will only fly back down to the ground after enough time passes, either by breathing fire onto the ground in Fire/Dragon Active mode or a Dragon divebomb in all Active modes.\nDepending on the specific quest, Alatreon will begin combat in a different elemental mode. It starts in Ice Active mode in the Event Quest Dawn of the Death Star, which cycles between itself and The Evening Star. Alatreon starts in Fire Active in every other quest.\nAfter enough time passes in Fire/Ice Active, Alatreon will transition to Dragon Active by creating a large Dragon element explosion. Eventually in this state, Alatreon will ready a powerful attack called Escaton Judgement, travelling to the centre of the area and build up power, before unleashing an area-spanning shockwave dealing continuous damage, before switching to the opposite of the Active state it was using before Dragon Active. Alatreon is not interruptable during Escaton Judgement. At its full power, Escaton Judgement will result in the near guaranteed cart to all hunters. \nHowever, in any active state, dealing enough elemental damage to them will cause them to topple and temporarily dispels their active element while it's downed. Escaton Judgement weakens each time Alatreon suffers an elemental knockdown, which resets after each one; at least one knockdown per cycle is required to survive, while subsequent knockdowns reduce its damage further.\nDuring Escaton Judgement's detonation, the Hunter cannot travel down to the 4th layer from the camp.\nAlatreon's horns can only be broken in the Dragon Active state, with breaking a horn neutralizing its ability to switch to the opposite element after Escaton Judgement (eg. if it started in Fire Active, it will now transition back to Fire Active after Escaton Judgement instead of changing to Ice Active). Only one horn can be broken each time it enters Dragon Active.\nIn Dawn's Triumph, Alatreon has significantly reduced health, but cannot be slain before performing at least one Escaton Judgement.",

This causes the effect to appear around Chameleos\u2019 mouth and cause them to gain the effect of the buff. Damaging Chameleos enough will cause them to drop the buff, otherwise they will swallow it causing the buff to be permanently lost. Chameleos are also capable of spewing out noxious poison, either as single blobs, continuous streams or as a ring along the ground that requires use of wirebugs to avoid. Chameleos can also use their poison attacks as counters after being flinched.\nChameleos are also capable of turning partially invisible during certain attacks as well as fully invisible to reposition.

        "hunter_notes": "Fatalis has two distinct stances: one where it stands upright on its hind legs, and one where it lays on all fours. Depending on which stance it's in, the moves Fatalis can use will differ. Using a Flinch Shot on it while it's standing will deal a small amount of damage and force it on all fours; it can only be slammed into a wall while already on all fours, which deals heavy damage to its head, but immediately enrages it.\nFatalis will be guaranteed to be knocked down after dealing enough damage with the siege emplacements around the map, or after breaking its head; however, it will prioritize attacking hunters using the siege weapons. It will flinch for every second Dragon Pod that hits it, or when its head takes enough damage. Fatalis can be forced on all fours by damaging its chest enough, although this can also crush unwary hunters.\nFatalis' phase transitions are heralded by the dragon flying off the map and bathing the arena in a torrent of flame that deals constant tick damage before intensifying after a few seconds, upon which any players still inside will be instantly wiped out. When transitioning to the second phase (at roughly 76% HP), hunters will be directed to hide behind a piece of metal debris that shields them from the blast. In the transition to the third phase (at roughly 50% HP), hunters must instead run to the castle gate and close it before the full brunt of the flames hits them.\nIn the second phase, Fatalis gains several new attacks and becomes able to fly for periods of time, breathing fire at hunters. The arena is slightly expanded, the cannons from the first phase are destroyed if not already, and the Roaming Ballista becomes available.\nIn the third phase, Fatalis will enter an enhanced state where its chest glows with incandescent light and its flames become bright whitish-blue, which dramatically enhances their damage to the point of likely causing an instant faint on any hit. The enhanced mode will weaken depending on how many times Fatalis' head has been broken; a single break weakens the flames to a purplish-orange, while two breaks reduces the flame to roughly the level it was in the previous phases. No matter how many times its head has been broken, all of Fatalis' fire attacks now leave behind pools of flame that deal persistent heat damage.\nFatalis will also begin using several new fire breath attacks, as well as a pin that has it melt the player to its chest and slowly burn them before flinging them off after a time; another player can flinch Fatalis with Dragon Pods to make it drop its victim. It will also use a powerful flame torrent attack akin to its phase transitions at fixed health thresholds (roughly 38%, 20%, and 5% HP), flying to a far side of the arena and unleashing a cone of flame that becomes invariably lethal after a few seconds, albeit now avoidable by getting behind Fatalis. If Fatalis' head has been broken twice, it is possible to survive the attack.\nFatalis is immune to  Stun and KO effects (including Flash Pods), and is heavily resistant to  Sleep and  Paralysis, making it likely to only trigger them once.",

        "characteristics": "A legendary black dragon known only as Fatalis. Rumored to have destroyed a kingdom in a single night, and has taken its castle for a roost.Fatalis sports a slender, near serpentine body covered in black scales. Its front and hind limbs are well-developed, allowing the dragon to display both a bipedal and quadruped gait, depending on the situation. The hind legs have been theorized to have structural similarities to those of Wyverians.[5]\nIts neck is disproportionately long, granting the creature great flexibility in how it angles its head, which is crowned by two pairs of back-facing horns. The front pair is notably larger and more developed. Fatalis' horns are said to give off a dark glow with a disturbing yet attractive property.[6]\nThe dragon also possesses large wings composed of wing arms (which constitute a third pair of limbs) and wing membranes that stretch over those arms. The wings are hard as steel and yet still flexible and malleable.[7] Despite the wing membranes being wrinkled and even slightly torn, they seem to nonetheless function flawlessly for flight.[8]\nLike the neck, the tail is also quite long and flexible. A row of spikes of variable size runs down Fatalis' spine, starting at the back of the neck and continuing all the way down to the tip of the tail.\nThe black scales of Fatalis have rings on them, indicating their immense age.[9] These scales together form a shell - sometimes also called a cortex - that displays an intricate layer structure, able to deflect attacks and grant the dragon incredible defense.[10] One especially noteworthy part of Fatalis' shell is the section on its chest: The shell plate here is called a Pectus, and is further hardened by having various metals - including the armor and weapons of fallen foes - melted onto it.[11]\nA unique anatomical feature of this dragon is its ability to generate an extremely powerful kind of flame called \"Kalpa Fire\".[12] This powerful fire ability allows Fatalis to inhale vast amounts of air, which is then heated by the dragon's infernal body temperature. Eventually, this creates an explosive flame, which can be released with tremendous force. Unleashed Kalpa Fire can destroy nearly any fortification and is extremely dangerous.[13] Over the course of a battle, the intensity of the Kalpa Fire can increase dramatically, growing so hot that it begins to visibly glow through the dragon's chest. At its most powerful, this devastating flame turns blue. Fatalis' Kalpa Fire is however noted to weaken if the dragon's horns are injured or broken.[14] It has overall been theorized that the dragon's power is in fact contained within its horns.[15]\nFatalis' eyes are a striking orange color, and are said to give off an ominous aura.[16] They have been described as crystalline in nature, and are considered one of the Three Great Treasures.[17]\nFatalis has been noted to not possess the characteristic Elder Dragon Blood - i.e. blood saturated with dragon-energy - which differentiates it from many other Elder Dragons.[14]",
        "behavior": "Very little is known about Fatalis' behavior. It appears to hibernate in or near Castle Schrade for long periods at a time.[8] Its presence seems to intimidate other monsters, as the movements of at least one Lao-Shan Lung were interpreted to be due to it fleeing from Fatalis. Conversely, there has never been any indication that Fatalis actually preys on other monsters.[8]\nIn battle, Fatalis appears to be somewhat cunning. It has been noted to only use its fire attacks sparingly at first, gradually unleashing them more frequently as the fight goes on. Once an enemy has proven themselves to be a real threat, Fatalis begins using its fire quite liberally while also continually increasing its potency.[13] It also has a habit of sticking out its long tongue and licking its lips.\nIts oddest behavior is its tendency to melt the weapons and armor of fallen enemies onto its chest. Within the Guild, some believe this to be intentional, while others argue that it simply happens as a result of the dragon dragging its body across the ground, which is often littered with the remains of its victims.[14]",
        "useful_information": "Useful Information: As long as its horns are intact, overcoming its final form's breath attack may be impossible. Cannons and ballistae can topple it. Flinch shots when its flying or standing will lower its head.",

Gaismagorm attacks with the explosive, crystallized Qurio on its carapace.

During their first phase, their back is covered in several crystals. Gaismagorm will primarily attack with their large wing-arms, slamming them and sweeping them across the ground. In this phase, these attacks create explosions around them. Sometimes after attacking or receiving damage, Gaismagorm will drop the crystals on their back on the ground. Eventually, Gaismagorm will leap to the centre of the arena before attempting to suck the hunter into a powerful Clap attack. This attack also summons rock debris which the hunter can hide behind to prevent being sucked in. If enough fallen crystals hit Gaismagorm while readying the attack, they will be toppled.\nUpon entering Phase 2, Gaismagorm will retreat to the lower reaches of the Yawning Abyss, shedding their crystals in the process. In Phase 2, Gaismagorm is capable of performing weaker suction attacks, as well as firing off blood lasers and meteor showers. Occasionally, Gaismagorm will attempt to scale the walls of the Abyss. During this attack, machine turrets are dropped down, which can be used to shoot at 3 swarms of Qurio on Gaismagorm\u2019s back in an attempt to destroy them. While this is occurring, Gaismagorm can summoning other swarms of Qurio that attempt to home towards the hunter, which can also be destroyed. Destroying 2 of the swarms on Gaismagorm's back will cause them to stumble down the wall, with destroying all 3 causing them to fall off the wall completely and be toppled. If not, Gaismagorm will fire a large blood laser and destroy the machine turrets before leaping off the wall.\nIn Phase 3, Gaismagorm\u2019s body will light \u201con fire\u201d while causing the Area to glow red.

Its hide is primarily grey with numerous bony ridges and spikes, and its whole body is lined with glowing blue vents, which are usually covered in layers of condensed Qurio energy resembling red crystals. It is flightless, with two enormous clawed arms in place of wings, which are dextrous and strong enough to tunnel through bedrock and throw large objects; their physiology suggests Gaismagorm was once capable of flight in ancient times, but has long since lost its wings to adapt to an underground lifestyle.[3] Its other four limbs are much smaller (with the back two being nearly vestigial), while its tail is large and thick, terminating in a five-fingered claw structure. Its head is stout and angular, with two twisted horns, beady yellow eyes, and a unique jaw structure that splits open to create a five-pointed star shape when it opens its mouth.\nWhen sufficiently enraged, the inside of its mouth starts glowing red, it sheds the layer of crystallized Qurio on its body, and the vents along its body also turn red and extrude feathery red structures. If angered even further, it will draw on more of the Qurio's power and become overloaded with energy, causing its vents to erupt with red flames.\nGaismagorm is the true host of the Qurio, allowing the parasites to feed on its energy and use it as a nest, while it is able to command them to gather nutrition and defend itself. In addition to sustenance, it is able to directly wield their energy by expelling it from the vents in its arms/torso as well as its mouth, usually in the form of explosive red beams or blasts. By consuming more life energy and Qurio, Gaismagorm is able to create a crystalline \"armor\" to protect itself, which can explode when enough force is applied, or simply output even more energy. However, its body does have limits, and it may become overloaded if it absorbs too much power.\nDue to its size, Gaismagorm's body is incredibly strong and durable, with it being able to shrug off multiple exploding Dragonators, falls from the surface to its nest, and blows of similar strength with only a brief interruption. It also boasts powerful lungs that can inhale or exhale massive amounts of air at once, which it uses to draw in or blow away targets, or suck up more Qurio to feed itself.",
        "behavior": "Gaismagorm's subterranean lifestyle and recent discovery leaves much of its behavior a mystery, but when it needs to feed, the monster will dig out a large underground nest, then create small pits through which it releases the Qurio to the surface. The parasites drain and consume all the life they can find in the area, followed by Gaismagorm collapsing its nest into a massive sinkhole for the Qurio to return en masse to feed their host. Highly voracious, Gaismagorm can depopulate entire ecosystems to feed itself, moving on to the next after an area has no more nutrition to offer.[4]\nDespite its aggressive nature, Gaismagorm can still realize when it is in danger, as it became more passive and hid from Malzeno after suffering major injuries from their battle, only resurfacing after Malzeno was slain.",

Its massive body is long, near serpentine, with short arms and legs that are usually folded to the body's side. Its tail is thick and wide. Out of its small face, two enormous tusks protrude, each as thick as a ship's mast. The rarely seen chin of the dragon is bulbous and covered in spiked bumps. On its back, the dragon has a blowhole from which it can breathe and expel sand it has ingested while swimming. The mouth and esophagus of the Jhen Mohran splits into two chambers through the use of a filter system: One side takes in food, the other the copious amounts of sand that it swallows, sending it to the blowhole to be expelled later.[3]\nWhile the monster appears to be a dull brown color to onlookers, the underlying scales of the Jhen Mohran are actually a bright blue.[4] The brown coloration is created by sand and other debris sticking to the skin and solidifying.\nA noteworthy feature of the Jhen Mohran is its back ridge, which is commonly covered in ore veins and mineral deposits. These deposits develop as the dragon swims through the sand sea, accumulating on its body through the force of its movement.[5] The rarest of these materials is the Earth Dragongem, a mysterious jewel only found on the body of this behemoth.[6]",
        "behavior": "The Jhen Mohran attacks nearby sand-ships by either ramming it with its dual tusks or with its side, requiring an experienced hunter to quickly react by either shooting a ballista binder or utilizing the sand-ship's hunting gong, both of which can temporarily stagger the monster, causing it's attack to miss.\nSometimes it might also shake is body off of excess rocks and minerals, causing large boulders to fall on the battlefield; a simple thing for a beast of such size, but for anyone unfortunate enough to be near it is very deadly.\nThe Jhen Mohran only rarely surfaces, and it is assumed that it does so to breathe and expel sand through its blowhole. In doing so, it releases enormous quantities of sand into the air with tremendous force, which is believed to actually cause the sandstorms the dragon's emergence is generally associated with.[7] Another omen of its appearance is the increased presence of Delex, which follow around surfacing Jhen Mohran to feed on organic matter that is swept to the surface by the movements of the massive monster.[5]",

It inspires such awe and wonder that news of a sighting draws a stampede of hunters from across the land.Threat: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605This colossal Elder Dragon shares many physiological features with the common Jhen Mohran. In fact, their skeletal structure is identical, and all differences are found in the organs and on the surface of the body.[2] Superficially, Hallowed Jhen Mohran have a darker skin tone and are covered in purple clusters of quartz, which is accumulated through the dragon's dives into the Great Desert, which sand off impurities and concentrate the mineral upon its body. The purer these crystals are, the more transparent they appear.[3]\nAs far as internal differences go, Hallowed Jhen Mohran are believed to have larger lungs than the common species.[4]",
        "behavior": "The Hallowed Jhen Mohran attacks nearby sand-ships by either ramming it with its dual tusks or with its side, requiring an experienced hunter to quickly react by either shooting a ballista binder or utilizing the sand-ship's hunting gong, both of which can temporarily stagger the monster, causing it's attack to miss.\nSometimes it might also shake is body off of excess rocks and minerals, causing large boulders to fall on the battlefield; a simple thing for a beast of such size, but for anyone unfortunate enough to be near it is very deadly.\nOutside of how it comports in combat, very little is known about the life of the Hallowed Jhen Mohran. Based on the enlarged lungs and purified minerals of the dragon, it is believed that this subspecies dives deeper into the sand sea than the common species.[5] Research into the Great Desert has suggested that it was at one point an actual ocean, and that its deepest depths contain condensed layers of ancient coral reefs. These layers are saturated with bacteria specialized in breaking down dead corals, and it has been proposed that these deep desert bacteria form the main diet of the Hallowed Jhen Mohran.[5]\nHallowed Jhen Mohran are even rarer than the common species, and only ever briefly surface from the sandy depths to take a breath exclusively at night. Curiously, they appear to stay on the surface for longer during the full moon.[3]",

Known by village elders as the \"Old Mountain Dragon,\" this elder dragon is covered in incredibly thick, thorny shells, giving it the appearance of a rocky mountain. The shell of the Lao-Shan Lung is thought to be composed of minerals, volcanic ash and other sediments, melted into the dragon's carapace by its body heat.[3] At birth, the dragon would not possess this shell, suggesting that the Lao-Shan Lung spends many years growing this shell, repeatedly heating and cooling the sediments that make up its hardened carapace.[3] This hypothesis of the formation of Lao-Shan Lung's shell has lead to scholars theorizing that the dragon spends most of its time in dormancy, only awakening when it is disturbed, which would explain why it is never seen when it isn't moving.[4] The colour of the shell may be different depending on the minerals used to form the shell, ranging from reddish brown to grey.[4]\nThe dragon's skull is adorned with several long, black horns, the longest of which being located at the end of its snout.\nWhile it moves slowly, the Lao-Shan Lung's legs are powerful, devastating towns and villages simply by walking through them.[4] Its claws are so big that even skilled artisans cannot work with the material.[5] The monster is capable of both quadrupedal and bipedal movement.",

As such, fortresses have been built along the known migration paths of Lao-Shan Lung in hopes of redirecting it away from towns and villages.\nDespite the devastation it causes, Lao-Shan Lung are docile and are said to almost never attack other creatures.[4] There was a report that a Lao-Shan Lung had appeared when a large mineshaft was built on the side of a mountain, but rather than acting aggressively towards whatever disturbed it, it simply ventured further underground.[3] Even during its crossing through human settlements, as ballista ammo and canons are fired into it, it only attacks the barricades that block its path.",

It uses the Qurio to drain the life energy of other living creatures, creeping around at night and attacking its prey from behind. It appears almost regal to start with, but after draining enough energy, it can turn a violent, fresh-blood crimson. This form is known as the \"Bloodening\" and is widely feared. Certain attacks will cause Bloodblight, causing your life to continuously drain but your attacks to also heal you; keep the pressure on. The Bloodening will occur after a certain amount of time, leading to raging attacks; end it and get a knock down by hitting the red flashing areas on the arms and neck.\nThreat Level: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Malzeno is a large, slender elder dragon with metallic silver scales, frills on the sides of its head, and red wings resembling tattered webbing. The wing membranes display scarlet patterns, which will be more vibrant if the Malzeno has recently fed on another creature.[3] It has large golden horns and claws, a flexible three pronged tail, and two sharp talons on its wing tips. Its chest is adorned with Qurio, appearing as if it were a gallant robe or cravat. Its head is almost skull-like, with red eyes and a bony fanged jaw. The fangs of a Malzeno are powerful enough to crush shell and bone alike.[4]\nAfter absorbing enough life energy, Malzeno will enter a \"Bloodening\" state, where its scales turn almost black, its wings and Qurio glow a bright red, and its tail starts radiating Dragon energy.[5]\nMalzeno has a special symbiotic relationship with the Qurio. The winged parasites absorb blood and energy from their prey and safely rest on Malzeno's chest and arms, and Malzeno is fed most of that nutrition and can use Qurio projectile clouds in combat. Becauses of its relationship with the Qurio, attacks from Malzeno can infect victims with their virus, manifested as bloodblight.\nOutside of the Qurio, Malzeno primarily uses its hooked wings and spiked tail to attack prey with agile physical blows or pins, as well as dragon element breath attacks. It boasts a deceptive amount of physical strength for its lithe frame, being able to tear up the ground, crush armor with its teeth, and lift or throw other large monsters similar in size to itself with its tail. When in the Bloodening state, its attacks become more violent and its speed is dramatically increased, with it notably being able to use bursts of the Qurio's energy to catapult its body short distances with such force that it looks as if it disappears and reappears in another location.",
        "behavior": "Due to its need to satisfy the voracious Qurio, Malzeno is a highly aggressive predator that constantly seeks prey for nutrition. It is known to primarily hunt at night, sneaking around and attacking prey from behind to catch them off guard.",

Ordinarily, it uses its wings and tail with the elegance of a knight, but under the Qurio's influence, it uses underhanded means of cornering its prey, and in it's \"Bloodlust\" state it wields tremendous power. Because of the explosive energy corrupting its body, it sometimes shows behavior as if its struggling against an overwhelming force.Once overwhelmed by the Qurio, it transitions into its \"Bloodening\" state, which culminates in \"Bloodrage\" as it is corrupted. Dealing damage is the only way to mitigate this state. When this Malzeno gets low on health, it enters its \"Bloodlust\" state. Attacks won't calm it down in this state, so extreme caution is advised.Primordial Malzeno resembles its infected version, but is more physically robust and well-built, being covered in thicker silver-and-gold scales resembling armor plating. The Qurio are completely absent from its body, with the Qurio patches being replaced by thick plated scales, while the frills on its head are now solid and metallic instead of membranous. Its wings are now sturdy and armored rather than gaunt and tattered, resembling large metal shields with blades on their edges, and its wing membranes are now bluish-purple instead of red.\nPrimordial Malzeno's physical attributes are dramatically stronger than a normal Malzeno, as it has not yet been drained by the parasitic Qurio and is not reliant on their power. It primarily fights using its armored wings as a sword and shield to both slash or stab enemies and protect itself, using them in combination with its lance-like tail and claws for relentless attacks. In spite of the immense physical force carried by its blows, Primordial Malzeno is extremely agile and fights with extreme precision and skill, with its fighting style being compared to that of an elegant knight.\nPrimordial Malzeno is not the host of the Qurio, and will actively attempt to kill any that approach it.

However, even in its original state, it is still intensely territorial and will destructively attack any intruders or threats in its turf. Unlike a normal Malzeno which uses underhanded tactics and stealth to ambush prey, Primordial Malzeno is known to battle enemies head-on and overcome them with strength and technique.\nPrimordial Malzeno are considered a major threat by the Hunter's Guild, and not just on the merits of their own power: As it has been confirmed that these dragons can succumb to the Qurio and turn into devastatingly powerful creatures that actively seek to drain ecosystems of life, the risk of a Primordial Malzeno being overtaken looms over any instance of it emerging, urging hunters to take action before the worst comes to pass.[4]\nIt demonstrates an unusually high level of intelligence, between its skillful use of its limbs as weapons and being able to seemingly show gratitude towards the Hunter and Fiorayne after they help save it. It is also said to hold a level of enmity towards the Qurio themselves due to the way they attempt to corrupt it and its brethren[1]. However, its behavior still stems from an animalistic urge to protect its territory, and any higher level of intelligence or sentience is unknown. They are believed to have very long lifespans.[5]",

Its penchant for destruction is well documented.Nergigante is a muscular elder dragon recognizable by its two bull-like, gigantic white horns on the sides of its head that fade into black at the tips, together with the countless spikes that adorn its whole body. Nergigante has a short yet wide skull with big fangs that are always on display, with a 'crown' of progressively large thorns adorning its head. It has striking yellow eyes with purple markings around them, resembling eyeshadow. It is predominantly a dark-grey color but has a colorful underbelly and wings, transitioning from shades of purple and pink to orange. It has huge spiked forearms packed with muscle, and has opposable thumbs like humans. Its hands and feet are in a naturally curled position when resting, with large beige claws and talons, while its hind legs are smaller and less beefy in comparison; in spite of this, it often stands up on two legs. It also unusually has paw pads on both its feet and arms. The long tail of Nergigante is covered with relatively fewer spikes than the rest of the body but reaches a higher density as it reaches the end of the tail, with one abnormally large spike at the very tip.\nNergigante's spikes grow incredibly quickly, and are formed when multiple of its scales grow and merge into each other[4]. Initially, the spikes are white, pliable and several dozen centimetres each, and are prone to breaking. Upon losing the spikes, it quickly sprouts a new set with rapid cell division. As they grow, they become increasingly hard and darker-colored due to prolonged oxidation[5], forming a black and metallic enamel-like layer. Approximately 1800 spikes adorn Nergigante.[5]\nSpike growth is localised around the neck, wing bends, back and tail end, which not only provide a solid defense for Nergigante, but also aid in its attacks as they are in locations that likely inflict as much damage as possible to targets[4], with many of Nergigante's physical blows carrying enough force to break the spikes and send them flying towards a target as a volley of deadly shrapnel. They can also frequently get lodged into surfaces due to its tendency to drag its body along the ground and use full-body tackles or dive bombs. A full set of hardened spikes can make it difficult for Nergigante to move, so it frequently sheds them.[5] In order to remain agile and conserve energy, majority of spikes do not grow on the underside of Nergigante's neck.[4]\nOnce over half of its spikes harden, Nergigante has the ability to instantly harden all of them.[6] It temporarily enters this steeled form to do a full-body divebomb tackle, throwing itself into the ground with an impact strong enough to send its hardened spikes flying in all directions. This attack is why the people of Astera call Nergigante the \"Eater of Elders\"[6]. This move additionally helps remove Nergigante's sometimes restrictive hardened spikes.",
        "behavior": "Nergigante is an extremely aggressive and voracious predator that is constantly on the hunt for large sources of bioenergy to consume to sustain its regenerative abilities[2], leaving behind a trail of destruction in its wake. Thus, it came to the New World and sought for the Zorah Magdaros, as its bioenergy yield was vast and pure[2]. It fights with no regard for its safety or wellbeing[2], using extremely violent physical blows that damage its own body as much as the target, although it has the ability to regenerate from any injuries. Even when exhausted and out of stamina, Nergigante becomes more agitated and fights with a more furious intensity. Due to this, people have called these attacks \"Ruinous Impulse\".[7]\nIt primarily attempts to prey on other Elder Dragons due to their high bioenergy yield, but it does not exclusively feed on them and considers almost everything potential prey, attacking them recklessly regardless of strength or size[2]. In spite of this, it can still be made to flee if put at an overwhelming disadvantage.\nNergigante are not native to the New World, and actually crossed the ocean from the Old World to reach the previously uninhabited continent. In fact, the area in the Elder's Recess which Nergigante occupies was once the home of the Lynian Gajalaka tribe.[7]",

Ruiner Nergigante has a darker overall colouration, due to its new black metallic spikes that grow in between its regular and now darker bone spikes.\nSome of the metallic spikes are reflective and shiny, resembling white crystals, called the \"Diamond Thorns\". These unique spikes form after countless battles where its thorns repeatedly break and regenerate,[5] which at a certain point, a mutation occurs that birth these silvery spikes.[6] This mutation also makes spikes stronger each time they break. Unlike the normal spikes, the diamond thorns cannot regenerate if destroyed, however they are more lethal and can cause lacerations when in contact. These vagrant spikes grow in areas of Ruiner's body that have encountered the repeated physical trauma.[7] Every time the monster senses danger, it gradually grows the diamond thorns on its forearms, wings and head.[7]\nIts two bull horns on its head are coated in a metallic gray, instead of the white and black colours, as they have hardened and turned black over years of conflict.[6]\nIn addition to its regenerative abilities, Ruiner Nergigante grows sharper and stronger thorns as its stamina decreases.[5] Destroyed spikes insantly regenerate and undergo a rapid \"super-regeneration\" process, in which the soft white spines immediately transform into the hardened, oxidised black spikes.[7]",

Thus, the more threatening the target, the greater the threat that Ruiner Nergigante will become if it survives the fight.

It has a long spiked tail, black horns twisted from excessive growth,[2] and a massive pair of ragged-looking beige wings which display constellation-like patterns when the monster is absorbing energy. Its snout is rather pointed, and it now has a single pair of orange, reptilian eyes as opposed to the multitude of orange bioenergy-sensing organs of its younger self Xeno'jiiva, which have degenerated due to lack of use. Its hide and scales have formed many complex, layered patterns from constant regrowth,[3][4] and are notably so tough that the majority of attacks will bounce off or do greatly reduced damage if no attempt to weaken the hide is made beforehand.\nAs the adult form of Xeno'jiiva, Safi'jiiva produces a seemingly endless amount of bioenergy to sustain itself, and is able to freely manipulate the bioenergy in its surroundings, allowing it to drain the life from the environment and reshape entire ecosystems to suit its needs. This notably gives it the ability to instantly recover from injuries by draining the bioenergy in its surroundings, rendering it nearly invulnerable as long as it has a supply of energy to absorb, although it can exhaust an area of energy and be forced to relocate if it exerts itself too much. Similar to Xeno'jiiva, it also wields this energy as various blue energy beams fired from its mouth, or explosions of energy to augment physical blows from its massive body. If pushed further, Safi'jiiva can expend a large amount of its bioenergy to unleash an attack known as the \"Sapphire of the Emperor\", a cataclysmic energy blast that completely destroys every other living thing in the vicinity.\nWhen near death, Safi'jiiva can enter a \"Supercritical State\" where the gaps between its scales, patterns on its wings, and inside of its throat glow bright white.

        "characteristics": "A mysterious elder dragon able to manipulate the earth itself. Vibrations from its wingtips reshape the earth, denying hunters footing.Shara Ishvalda initially covers itself in a thick armor of rock and sand, stuck to its body by an adhesive secretion.[6] In this form, which is called its \"Rock-wrapped State\" (\u5ca9\u7e8f\u3044\u72b6\u614b),[6] it appears as an enormous, bulky golem-like dragon made of numerous beige, blue, and yellow rocky chunks, many of which can be seen shifting and shuddering as it moves. Its body is stout, with four somewhat stubby legs, a short tail, and two enormous four-fingered structures resembling hands or claws in place of wings. Its head is blocky in shape, with an armored jaw that is capable of movement despite its solid appearance, and two beady, faintly glowing yellow \"eyes\" visible deep within the rock plating.\nIts true body, hidden beneath the rock layer, is a slender, near emaciated dragon with a gnarled hide resembling a cross between wood and stone. It is primarily beige in coloration, although the ends of its limbs and chest are more blue and stony, while the tips of its wingarms are pinkish. Its wingarms and tail are now spindly and resemble plant roots, with each digit of its true wingarms being flexible enough to move independently. Its head bears a crown-like crest and a pair of initially closed eyes, which have degenerated due to its underground lifestyle, with the monster instead using a unique sensory organ in its forehead crest to \"see\".[7] When sufficiently angered, its eyes are revealed to be greenish-yellow with shrunken red pupils.\nUsing powerful vibrations emitted from its wingtips, Shara Ishvalda can dissolve earth into sand, which it uses to tunnel through terrain. Through these vibrations, it is also able to induce seismic activity over an enormous area, causing earthquakes and tectonic disruptions powerful enough to permanently reshape local geography and climate. The vibrations produce a \"song\" reminiscent of howling wind, which can be heard across vast distances and greatly irritates other monsters, causing them to exhibit anomalous behavior. For example, it is believed that the vibrations of this song disrupt the natural navigation instincts of migratory monsters and especially flying wyvern such as the Legiana.[8]  When threatened, Shara Ishvalda also utilizes these vibrations for self-defense, being able to fire destructive sonic \"beams\" resembling pressurized air, turn the terrain into quicksand, trigger seismic explosions, or concentrate its vibrations into enormous beams or blasts.",
        "behavior": "Very little is known about Shara Ishvalda's behavior as it was abruptly discovered for the first time, then promptly slain. It is known that the monster lives a strictly subterranean lifestyle and seldom surfaces (if at all), and that it was first discovered while burrowing along the energy-rich Everstream. It can be presumed to be rather territorial, as it attacked the Sapphire Star and Ruiner Nergigante shortly after they got close to its resting place.\nWhen approached, Shara Ishvalda is initially slow and cumbersome thanks to its rock armor, and uses rather conservative attacks to fend off intruders, only seldom using its ability to reshape the earth. All of this changes if its attackers manage to strip its rock armor and reveal its true form, upon which Shara Ishvalda becomes drastically more aggressive and uses all of its strength to eliminate them.",

The hide is armored with a flexible and light carapace that can ward off attacks without infringing on the dragon's mobility.[2] Vibrant orange tentacles line the dorsal side of its body and its arms, which turn brighter and purple as they accumulate electricity, while it also has larger, purple sacs on its head, chest, arms, and tail. Its head has a pair of straight horns, beady yellow eyes, and two sets of nested jaws that split open when the monster opens its mouth.\nNarwa uses the numerous tentacles and specialized organs called Sparksacs[3] across its body to accumulate a vast electrical charge, which gives it the ability to freely float by producing magnetic fields that repel its body off the ground.[4] It discharges this electricity through a variety of yellow and purple electric attacks primarily fired from its mouth and belly sac, such as rings, beams, pillars, and bolts of electricity fired in dense patterns. Because of its control over magnetism, it is also able to freely lift and throw metal-containing objects or terrain, or even pull them out of the earth. The scale of its electricity output can cause severe burns in its vicinity while passively causing violent thunderstorms to engulf its surroundings.\nDeep within its body, the Thunder Serpent grows a mysterious orb said to grant whoever wields it dominion of thunderstorms. If and how this orb is related to the Narwa's abilities is currently unknown.[5]",
        "behavior": "Narwa's behavior beyond the mating cycle is unknown, as it has never been seen outside of it. While mating, it aggressively attacks anything that could be percieved as a threat to itself, its future young, or its mate Ibushi. However, it is less nomadic than its mate, preferring to stake out a territory and wait for Ibushi to come to it.",

This is skipped in Master Rank.\nNarwa primarily uses the Thunder element to attack, most commonly in the form of rings of thunder that will gradually expand or as lightning lasers. She is also capable of performing some wind-based attacks as well as attacking using her tail. Some attacks will raise up boulders that can act as platforms to stand on.\nNarwa will begin the fight will lightning covering her head, forearms, back and tail. Damaging these parts enough will remove the charge from them. Removing the charge from enough of her body parts will topple her, allowing easy access to her thunder sac for damage.\nNarwa progresses through 3 phases over the course of the fight that change up her moveset. To transition between these phases, Narwa will perform a special attack where she flies to the centre of the arena and firing off lightning pillars and electric rings around her. This is followed by her summoning 6 Dragonators that spin around her while sucking the hunter towards her. If she is damaged enough in this state, she will be toppled and the remainder of the attack is cancelled. If not, she will fly higher into the air before shooting an orb to the ground which explodes into a giant ring along the ground, which can be avoided by standing on the rocks she summons. In Phase 3, the Dragonator portion of the attack onwards can be performed whenever.\nBefore transitioning to Phase 3, a random monster will invade the quest: be it Magnamalo, Kushala Daora or Teostra.

The large thunder sac on its belly now visibly holds Narwa's eggs, seen within as eight translucent orbs. Unlike its original variant, Narwa the Allmother's eyes will turn red when it is enraged.\nAs a result of consuming Wind Serpent Ibushi's \"lifeforce\", the wind sacs on Narwa's body become active, allowing it to inherit Ibushi's command over wind while drastically increasing the power of its own electrical abilities.[3] It is able to use Ibushi's draconic wind to create violent tornadoes and updrafts, using them in conjunction with its enhanced electric attacks, which take on a similar form to its original self but with far greater potency and range. Its control over electromagnetism is also greatly enhanced, allowing it to lift and throw massive objects like Dragonators with no visible exertion.[1]\nDeep within its body, the Allmother is said to grow a great treasure that is spoken of in legends.[4]",
        "behavior": "Narwa the Allmother is driven primarily by maternal instinct, seeking to protect its offspring at any cost. As a result of being close to laying its eggs, it is much more aggressive than its usual self, and devotes all of its effort towards destroying anything that could be percieved as a threat to its young. These behaviors, as well as the discovery that Narwa and Ibushi are two mated elder dragons belonging to the same species, are considered incredibly valuable insights that are expected to shape monster research in the future.[1]\nHistorical records suggest that the emergence of an Allmother has drastic effects on the surrounding environments, with large monsters and even other Elder Dragons moving towards her place of appearance for unclear reasons.[1]",

Its scales are jagged in appearance, with several large spines protruding from its back. It has an avian head and blue eyes with red sclera, and lacks nostrils, with it instead inhaling air using a set of vents on its chest. Its body is extremely resilient, able to endure the wear and heat from its high-speed flight,[2] the shock from collisions at top speed, and its scorching hot internals.[3]\nThe wings of Valstrax are a highly unusual structure unlike almost any other monster seen so far. Connected to its body by highly flexible limbs, each wing resembles a three-pronged trident structure connected together by elastic wing membranes, each prong being extremely sharp and having an opening on the back end. The wings themselves are also extremely flexible, being able to freely extend, stretch, and fold into a vast array of configurations despite their lack of visible musculature. The spined shells lining its wings will periodically be shed as burning scraps as the monster flies.\nBy sucking in air, compressing it, and infusing it with dragon energy produced within its body, Valstrax is able to expel fiery energy from the vents on its wings in a manner similar to rocket propellant.[4] Using this propulsion, Valstrax is able to fly at supersonic speeds, or simply hover in place by pointing its wings downwards. The energy expelled from its wings is also used as a means of attack, either as extra thrust for supersonic stabs and strikes with its wings while they're pointing backwards, or as explosive blasts and energy barrages while its wings are pointing forwards. The energy emitted by its wings is highly volatile and can leave behind explosive aftershocks.\nWhen enraged, Valstrax's head crest and wings will glow with red Dragon energy.",

It is covered in a light blue, rubbery hide, while its claws and lower body are covered in grey scales and have numerous slits resembling gills. It has paddle-like fins, numerous dorsal spines running along its spine, and a large crest of bony spikes protruding from its head, which has blank yellow eyes and two sets of nested jaws that split open when the monster opens its mouth. When enraged, Ibushi's eyes turn orange and the gills on its body start glowing red.\nSeveral bluish-indigo wind sacs are found on its arms, back, chest, and tail. These sacs create, store, and expel a special lighter-than-air gas that give it the ability to freely float and manipulate the wind around it.[1] Expulsion and modulation of this gas give it a variety of abilities for combat, most commonly by creating violent currents or blasts of dragon-infused winds that can lift heavy objects or blow away obstacles. Its nature of flight and wind manipulation also causes violent wind turbulence and draconic storms around it, which can reshape the landscape and force nearby monsters to flee.\nMany myths tell of the legendary dorsal horns of Ibushi, which are said to contain the power to wield the sky itself.[1] Simultaneously, other tales tell of a jewel that grows within the dragon's body that grants the power to bend storms to one's will.[3] To what extent either of these features are involved in the dragon's command over wind is currently unknown.",

During its mating process, it is single-minded in searching for Narwa, only stopping to remove obstacles or enemies that get in its way. It is this pursuit, and the accompanying storms, that are believed to be the source of the phenomenon known as the Rampage, where hundreds of monsters stampede in a frenzy, now interpreted as them fleeing the wrath of the Ibushi.[4]",

Continuous friction will cause their body temperature to rise, but soften their outer shells.Ajarakan is a Fanged Beast with an ape-like build and stance, boasting a muscular body with highly developed forelimbs that can grapple foes and easily climb terrain, while its hind limbs are much smaller in comparison. Its body is covered in coppery scales and shells, which are mostly red in coloration and become more black closer to the ends of its limbs, while the scales on its face and upper body have tinges of teal resembling oxidized copper. Its face is affixed in a perpetual snarl, with a flame-like crest adorning it, while its back also boasts a much larger carapace of twisted, flame-like shells. Its tail is fairly long and thick, with a wide, gnarled club-like structure at the tip. It has highly flexible hands with four digits, including a thumb. On the back of its hands, the Ajarakan grows hardened white pads that allow it to walk on its knuckles comfortably.[2]\nThe scales of Ajarakan are spiked at their tips, somewhat resembling small flames.[3] They are extremely tough, said to resist scratches from even the toughest natural materials.[4] These scales form the Ajarakan's shell, characterized by its rough surface texture, which allows it to produce sparks in response to even minor friction.[5] Its dense structure allows this carapace shell to withstand the explosive force that the Ajarakan wields.[6] Multiple sections of these shells then merge on the back of the beast into the Ajarakan's distinctive rigde, which has often been likened to flames in color and shape.[7][8]\nThe bone marrow of an Ajarakan maintains a high temperature and is considered almost too hot to handle.[9] This is a trait it shares, curiously, with the brainstem of the beast - the Ajarakan's Medulla burns so hot, it has been said to be as if all of the Ajarakan's heat was concentrated on it.[10] Like many other monsters, the Ajarakan also rarely grows a jewel in its body, which burns hot and has powerful explosive properties.[11][12]\nAjarakan cover themselves in molten metal, which hardens and reinforces their carapaces and scales. By scraping the metal on its carapace against itself or the ground, Ajarakan is able to generate immense amounts of heat and friction, enough to melt parts of the ground its heated body parts come into contact with. The friction also allows it to create massive explosions, ignite its surroundings, and even melt incoming projectiles. When fully heated up, the Ajarakan's back and head shells will glow incandescently.[13]",
        "behavior": "Ajarakan are primarily active during the Firespring of the Oilwell Basin, and aggressively attack any potential prey or intruders on sight. When engaging a target, they will beat their tails against their back shells both as a warning and to heat themselves up, before roaring and beginning to attack.\nThey have been at times observed hunting in packs of 2-3 individuals.",

An incredibly curious beast, it enjoys playing tricks on people, and has been seen to bat fruit at its prey using its tail.Its varied tail attacks are incredibly powerful, and sometimes it spins around like a top, so avoiding damage can be tough. But, if you use that chance to attack, the beast will drop its fruit, and you can pick it up and throw it back, aiding your hunt. Watch its moves carefully to find your opening.",

Destroying a Blangonga\u2019s tusks is believed to undermine its authority with the other Blangos, disrupting their teamwork.Blangonga is a large-bodied Fanged Beast distinguished by its coat of long, snow white fur and colourful, ornamented face. Its naked skin is coloured a cool, almost frostbitten blue across most of the body, and is exposed on its hands, feet, belly, and face, which is decorated by grooved cyan skin running from below the eyes to the mouth, with a red line in the middle connecting the thick, horned brow-ridges to the nose and upper lip, from which another pair of red horns grow out to the sides. Sprouting from its face are a pair of whiskers, which turn yellow at the tufted tips, and the top of its bald scalp is coloured a lighter blue.\nBlangonga fur is extremely resilient, and prized in cold regions for its uses in textile work.[2] It has been noted to have powerful thermal properties while also being comparable to iron chainmail in terms of defensive strength.[3] The tips of the hairs that make up this fur are pointy and needle-like.[4] The fur on the tail is quite soft and pleasant to the touch.[5] Some eastern religions are known to wear clothes made from Blangonga Fur as ritual garbs.[6]\nThe most notable feature of Blangonga are their large tusk-like canines which protrude out of the mouth considerably. They are as thick as a human thigh[7] and extremely sharp and deadly.[8]\nLike other Fanged Beasts with prehensile hands such as Rajang or Congalala, Blangonga walk on their knuckles and fists, though they will sometimes fall onto their palms, or use them to push themselves off the ground for a leap. Their forelimbs are proportionally long, and during battles are used to club and wrestle opponents, while the hindlimbs are short; both are muscular and well developed, permitting Blangonga to easily traverse the cliffs and gorges of their mountainous homes with leaps and bounds.\nBlangonga possess a more developed Frost Sac than the smaller Blangos, allowing them to expel a super-cooled breath that freezes whatever it comes into contact with to the ground. This breath is generated through the Blangonga inhaling the cold mountain air of its home and cooling it down further in its specialized organ.[9] They will also use their forelimbs to hurl up large quantities of snow and ice or burrow themselves into the thick snowpack to ambush victims from below.",
        "behavior": "The Blangonga is the leader of a Blango troop, easily identified by its greater size and elaborate facial ornamentation. With a bellowing roar, it commands the Blango under its charge, but its leadership is not assured: a Blangonga owes its status in the troop's hierarchy to its pair of enlarged canines protruding from its maxilla; if these are broken, its control over the troop will lessen significantly.[10]\nThe regions these Monsters inhabit are worlds of scarcity: eternal winters entrap the mountainous peaks, perpetually pushing its inhabitants to the brink of starvation, fuelling high aggression. Blangonga are highly territorial, and sicc their Blango troop at perceived threats with extreme prejudice to secure what little resources are available. Within the Iceshard Cliffs, Blangonga compete with other macrocarnivores, such as the Leviathan Hirabami, which they can physically overpower and drive from their turfs.\nBlangonga are considered extremely intelligent due to their sophisticated use of social hunting strategies. Their main tactic consists of instructing their Blango to hide beneath the snow in specific spots. The Alpha, aided by the rest of the troop that is not hidden, identifies prey and then chases it towards where its brethren lie in wait. Once the prey is close, the Blango beneath the snow leap out, surrounding the target and pelting it to death with simultaneous attacks.[9] They have also been observed rubbing off paintballs from their bodies, implying a degree of awareness of their role in hunting. As a result, there have been many cases of hunters becoming discouraged and giving up hunting after failing to outsmart a Blangonga.[11]\nAs the troop leaders, they are also seemingly tasked with marking their local territory using their feces.[12]",

Like the base species Copper Blangonga have large tusks, and limbs strong enough to lift and throw large chunks of earth at attackers, and burrow underground for a surprise attack. They appear to have greater physical strength than the common species, possibly suggesting enhanced musculature.[2]",
        "behavior": "Copper Blangonga are quite rare, and as such not much is known about them. Thus far they have only been seen in the Old Desert.\nOne key difference between this and the common species is that Copper Blangonga are exclusively sighted alone - they do not seem to form packs at all, and no desert equivalent of Blango have ever been discovered. It has been suggested that the harsh deserts this species calls home are too rough to sustain large packs, and that only the strongest individuals survive by carving out a lonesome existence.[2][3]",

In addition to increased size Bulldrome distinguish themselves with long, white hairs on the sides of their head, and running down their back in a Mohawk style.\nA notable feature of Bulldrome are their asymmetrical curved tusks, with one being much longer than the other. Which tusk is longer differs between individuals[2] and is behaviorally determined. Every Bullfango has one tusk it prefers to use while digging up soil and looking for food. This foraging tusk is ground down through use and thus remains shorter. Whichever tusk an individual Bullfango does not prefer for foraging is instead used for intimidation and combat, growing larger by comparison. While this difference is hardly noticeable in Bullfango, it becomes much more pronounced on Bulldrome.[3]",
        "behavior": "Bulldrome are known to lead packs of Bullfango, offering the pack protection. In exchange for this protection Bulldrome are known to forcefully take their share of the food, bullying the smaller Bullfango out of their feeding spots.[3]\nThey're otherwise identical to Bullfango, their offense consisting exclusively of charging at a threat, and sometimes thrashing their tusks side to side.",

While not carrying anything in their tail, they are also capable of excreting into it and throwing their dung forward.\nCongalala are capable of performing various breath attacks depending on the type of mushroom they have recently eaten. Periodically, Congalala will sniff into the air before going over to a patch of mushrooms to pick up one in its tail, which it will produce to eat to change the effect of its breath. By default, Congalala's breath will inflict  Soiled. After consuming red Nitroshrooms, its breath will inflict  Blastblight, after consuming yellow Parashrooms, its breath will inflict  Paralysis and after consuming purple Toadstools, its breath will inflict  Poison.\nOccaisonally, Congalala will instead dig into the ground before pulling out a black Truffle Du Conga. Consuming this mushroom will give Congalala access to all their breath attacks at once. However, if they are flinched, they will drop the mushroom which can then be picked up as an item and used as a cooking ingredient.\nIf caught in a Pitfall Trap, Congalala will fall into it face first, leaving their rear exposed. While enraged, Congalala are capable of farting in retaliation while trapped.\nWhile performing their breath attacks, Congalala's rear will become a weak point for Focus Strikes.",

        "behavior": "Brutish and aggressive, Doshaguma are ferociously territorial and will attack any interlopers on sight, overwhelming enemies and prey with pure physical strength. They are known to prey on herbivores like Ceratonoth and Dalthydon, and will even throw them at other foes in the vicinity. Their aggressive and predatory behavior often gets them into disputes with other predators of their habitats, like Balahara.\nAlthough generally solitary creatures, Doshaguma have been sometimes observed moving in packs. As Doshaguma are powerful enough to be self-sufficient, it is speculated that Doshaguma join packs solely due to the prospect of bringing down more powerful prey that they would otherwise be unable to kill by themselves.[2] As a result of this, packs of Doshaguma have virtually no cooperation nor unity, and the members are prone to violent infighting over food and resources.\nOn occasion, a larger Alpha Doshaguma may rally a pack of followers by using their superior strength to force the others to submit. Emboldened and kept in line by the Alpha's strength, these packs exhibit more aggressive roaming and predatory behavior, and are slightly more unified. However, the death of the Alpha will cause the pack to fall into disarray and scatter in short order.",

Though mainly herbivores, Lagombi occasionally make use of their exceptional hearing and ability to glide on ice to sneak up on prey.A Lagombi has very sensitive hearing, and Sonic Bombs will cause it to flinch in pain. Time a well-aimed throw for when it's sliding around, and you may topple it. When enraged, however, Sonic Bombs have no effect on it.A medium-sized fanged beast, Lagombi has a body frame similar to its relative Arzuros, albeit more reminiscent of a giant rabbit. Its head sports a pair of long and highly sensitive ears (which gives them a weakness to loud noises), as well as a beak-like structure over the mouth, facilitating the process of picking up food. It is covered from head to toe in white fur and a thick, subcutaneous layer of fat, making it highly adapted to frigid environments.\nThe belly of a Lagombi is not furry, but rather covered with an elastic plastron. Said plastron is lined with hardened ridges that serve to cut and shear the snow, allowing for fast, stable and surprisingly silent movement. By pouncing and landing onto the plastron with momentum, Lagombi can slide around the ground at high speeds. Lagombi plastrons become polished over many years of use, eventually turning into a tough and smooth armor shell.[3]\nLagombi's claws have a unique curvature to them, specialized for gripping and stabbing into the snow. While sliding, Lagombi can dig these claws into the snow to perform emergency brakes and tight turns. Like Arzuros, it grows a shell bracer\u2014though not as developed or spiky\u2014that enhances the claws' durability. Due to their constant exposure to the cold, Lagombi claws are often covered in a thin layer of permanent frost.[4] This causes wounds created by these claws to freeze over instantly, giving the beast an additional offensive ability.[5][6]\nGiven how well the claws can handle massive amounts of snow, Lagombi can dig its hands into the ground and launch large snowballs at its enemies, slowing them down and freezing them. Meanwhile, the legs are highly muscular, allowing Lagombi to leap into the air and come crashing down violently, or quickly pounce, allowing it to reposition with a slide at rapid pace.",
        "behavior": "Lagombi are generally herbivorous, feeding on the scarce nuts and plants that they find in their frigid homelands. They can however eat meat and will actively hunt prey on rare occassions.[7] Using their superior sense of hearing, Lagombi track prey across the snowy tundras. By not relying on their eyes, these beasts completely avoid the adverse effect on vision that the glaring sunlight reflected by snow usually has on wanderers in the frost, while also being less affected by blinding blizzards. Additionally, a Lagombi sliding on its plastron is suprisingly silent, increasing the beast's stealth significantly. Thus, Lagombi hunt by identifying prey from afar through sound and then sneaking up rapidly on it by sliding.[1]",

Their saliva emits a paralyzing toxin that should be avoided.The toxin that Volvidon spit out can paralyze on contact. You'll also want to carry some Deodorant, as the gas they emit can cover you in a stench so powerful that it makes it impossible to stomach anything.Volvidon is a medium-sized monster, with the same basic body plan as its close relatives, Arzuros and Lagombi. However, it displays significant physiological differences beyond that. For one, its face is flat and long, and the hands only have four fingers\u2014as opposed to five on both of its rlatives\u2014with the second finger and claw being abnormally large, often compared to a trowel. Most intriguingly, its body is covered not in fur, but in a red shell.\nThis segmented armor is thick and sturdy, yet elastic, granting the beast high defense with virtually no downsides to its mobility. The shell is also supremely heat-resistant, able to withstand magma for a short while.[3] The resilience of this material is so well-developed that Volvidon shells are noted by blacksmiths to be extremely difficult to work with.[4] By curling its body, the segments on Volvidon's shell overlap such that they turn the creature's body into an armored ball. The elasticity of the shell is also capable of redistributing force. Thus, by strategically contracting and expanding the muscles under it, Volvidon can bounce while rolled up, gathering momentum and moving at high speeds.\nAnother trait that makes Volvidon stand out from its close relatives is its tongue, which is prehensile and can extend to a total length of nearly 20 meters. While this adaptation seems to have emerged for feeding purposes, it can also serve as a weapon: During combat, Volvidon may use its long tongue as a whip, striking foes from afar with wide-ranging attacks.\nMany of the insects Volvidon devours, such as Bnahabra, contain various paralytic poisons. When feeding, these poisons are stored in its paralysis sac, which connects to its saliva glands.[5][1]  By mixing these compounds in its mouth, Volvidon can spit globules of concentrated paralysis venom, which is absorbed by the skin of whoever gets splashed by it. Furthermore, when digesting the shells of insects, the monster's gut produces various foul gases, which get stored in a layer under its skin. When necessary, Volvidon can expel these gases from the gaps between its shell segments, dowsing any unlucky enemy in a pungent cloud of odor.",
        "behavior": "Volvidon are omnivorous, but have a strong preference for insects. It can infiltrate Altaroth nests and pull them out of their tunnels, or it can swipe Bnahabra straight out of the air using its long tongue.[1]",

These scutes are covered in nicks and cracks from countless battles in virtually all Magnamalo.[3] It has a pair of intricate horns on its head, enlarged claws on its forearms that have grown to resemble blades,[4] and a long tail tipped with a bony point resembling a spear tip. Its arm blades, fangs, and tail tip can fold in and out at will, with its tail being able to unfold into a cross shape when hunting prey.[5] Its underbelly is red and less armored, with these red scales also filling in the gaps in its carapace to allow it to move properly.\nMagnamalo hunts prey using the various \"weapons\" on its body, then processes the bones of consumed prey into a gaseous, explosive purple substance known as \"Hellfire\", which is first condensed in the body as solid prisms.[6] When needed, a Magnamalo expels gaseous Hellfire from small vents on its arms, tail, mouth, and back,[1] engulfing its body in ghostly purple flames and producing a characteristic eerie howling sound. It uses this volatile gas to hunt by spreading explosive clouds, shooting blasts of flame, creating explosions with its physical blows, and propelling itself with miniature explosions, the last of which allows it to grapple and bring down flying prey. The longer its Hellfire burns for, the more volatile and pink it turns.\nInside the body, Magnamalo grow mysterious purple orbs that seem to glow with the light of lost souls.[7] It is unknown if this is at all related to its Hellfire.\nBecause of the high metabolism required to sustain its Hellfire, it can quickly regain its vitality and recover from injury given enough food nearby.[8] However, Magnamalo's horns only grow once in its life and can never be regrown if broken.[1]",

The quality and size of a Magnamalo's horns and carapace are known factors for sexual selection, and a male Magnamalo whose horns are broken will be unable to mate for the rest of its life.[1] If this occurs, the Magnamalo will forgo mating and protecting its carapace in favor of recklessly hunting stronger prey to increase its strength and the power of its Hellfire, with the most tenacious and extreme individuals potentially developing into Scorned Magnamalo.[9]",

        "characteristics": "A Magnamalo variant that achieves an even more twisted, malevolent form. Filled with hatred, they are known as \"Scorned Magnamalo.\" Shrouded in Hellfire at all times, they also boast larger arm blades and harder armor plating. During battles, they have been spotted focusing their Hellfire and swinging it like a blade.When these variants concentrate their Hellfire, they can unleash powerful attacks but also become more susceptible to damage if the Hellfire on their body is detonated. Press the attack further to send them into the Raging Hellfire state. But beware of powerful attacks from the body parts infused with Hellfire.Scorned Magnamalo broadly resembles regular Magnamalo, with the most notable differences being its much larger, serrated back shells and arm blades. It is missing an eye and horn compared to normal specimen, has noticeably larger fangs, and is covered in faintly glowing red scars. Its entire body is darker in coloration and shrouded in pink Hellfire at all times, even when not in combat. It is also entirely covered in bruises and scratches, down to even its individual scales.[3]\nScorned Magnamalo is able to concentrate its Hellfire on specific parts of its body. Although Hellfire is normally present across its whole body, it will unfold its arm blades and focus all of its Hellfire into them once enraged, extinguishing its back and tail. If further angered, it will reignite its tail and unfold the shells on its back.\nScorned Magnamalo is much stronger than a normal Magnamalo, having gained more mastery over their Hellfire and enhanced physicality, particularly a new mastery of its arm blades. The Hellfire produced by a Scorned Magnamalo is also more condensed and thus more explosive and violent.[4] It unleashes extremely violent attacks that cover a wide area with explosions, such as wielding its arm blades to perform multiple slashing attacks in succession, or concentrating its Hellfire to produce pressurized blasts akin to swinging a blade of flame. When sufficiently enraged, they can enter a \"Raging Hellfire State\" where their Hellfire becomes red and infused with dragon element, allowing it to inflict dragonblight.[5] The one eye of a Scorned Magnamalo has an eerie glow that is said to never fade even after being removed from the wyvern's socket.[6]",
        "behavior": "A Scorned Magnamalo is said to come to be when a male Magnamalo has its horns broken for any reason, rendering it undesirable for females and unable to mate for the rest of its life. As a result, the Magnamalo forgoes mating and focuses entirely on hunting prey, recklessly facing and devouring increasingly dangerous foes to accumulate power and bolster its Hellfire. If the Magnamalo survives for long enough, it can undergo gradual morphological changes that turn it into a Scorned Magnamalo.\nBeing \"scorned\" by their kind and a lifetime of battle scars has caused Scorned Magnamalo to become even more aggressive than usual, to the point where onlookers describe it as a malevolent demon filled with hatred. It ruthlessly attacks anything that approaches its territory, and will actively seek out powerful foes to battle and devour, even Elder Dragons.[4] Because it no longer needs to protect its horns and armor, it is especially reckless, battling with no regard for its own safety.",

        "characteristics": "A terrifying monster that scours the Rotten Vale for carrion. Its highly aggressive nature means that anything, be it monster or man, is a potential meal.Odogaron are terrifying fanged wyvern that are covered in a highly textured, red skin. Their bodies are slender, displaying near zero fat tissue and instead being highly muscular and defined.[3] The heads of Odogaron end in long snouts, with multiple rows of teeth visible at all times. The top and bottom canine teeth are notably enlarged. The jaw and neck muscles of Odogaron are deceptively powerful, allowing this species to carry large flying wyvern such as Legiana in their mouths.[6]\nOdogaron eyes are a dull blue color and never close. That is because they do not have eyelids. Instead, the entire eyeball is covered in a thick cornea that is adapted to withstand the effects of the Effluvium found in the places Odogaron inhabit. This makes the eyesight of the wyvern quite poor, enabling it only to differentiate between light and dark.[7] This however does not pose much of a problem - in the dimly lit Rotten Vale, eyesight is not a particularly useful sense to begin with.[8] Additionally, this reduced eyesight makes Odogaron unaffected by the flashes of light produced by monsters such as the Tzitzi-Ya-Ku, which they might encounter while hunting.\nTo compensate for their weak eyes, Odogaron have an extremely well developed sense of smell,[9] which can be further enhanced by widening their large and flexible nostrils.[8] Armed with their strong olfactory skill, Odogaron can easily distinguish between the different smells of corpses, identifying fresh ones and locking onto various tracks, especially favoring the smell of blood.[8]\nA very notable physiological feature of Odogaron are their unique claw structures. Odogaron posses two sets of claws on their feet: Four walking claws, which are stuff and protrude from the knuckles, sitting on top of hard round pads which make contact with the ground. In addition to this set, Odogaron have six battle claws that usually remain folded upwards towards the ankle. Most of the time, the battle claws remain retracted, which allows Odogaron to walk without making any sound. When prey is spotted, Odogaron extend their battle claws downwards, which are long and serrated. By slashing at targets with these claws, Odogaron can create brutal gashes that bleed profusely.[9]\nAs they do not tend to store fat, Odogaron need near constant calorie input to survive. Should an Odogaron eat after a long period of fasting, it might enter a special state called the Full-body Flush. During this state, the body of the wyvern pulsates with a red glow and steam erupts from its mouth. Odogaron are also significantly more aggressive during this state. The mechanisms behind the Full-body Flush are not entirely understood yet, but it is believed that it is a result of the wyvern's body temperature suddenly spiking as digestion kicks in, combined with the Odogaron's excitement at finally being able to eat again.[9]\nThe tails of Odogaron are distinguishable by their numerous hard white protrusions at the tip. These are hardened veils of skin, which grow and develop over the wyvern's lifetime. Juvenile Odogaron mostly lack them, growing them as they mature. In fact, these protrusions never stop growing, and can even allow an Odogaron to regrow some length of its tail after it has been severed.[8]",
        "behavior": "Odogaron are entirely endemic to the New World and have thus far never been sighted anywhere else. They inhabit the Rotten Vale and the Guiding Lands, where they are known to be brutal predators and scavengers, acting purely on a single-minded instinct to kill and feed, earning themselves the nickname \"Cruel Claw\".[10] Perfectly adapted to the corpse heap of the new continent, Odogaron sniff out the freshest corpses before any other scavenger can even think of claiming them.[8]\nOdogaron will also actively hunt, overwhelming prey with their superior speed and agility. One brutal tactic they employ is to lacerate their target with their battle claws early on, condemning them to a slow death by blood loss - and even if they should get away, the nose of the Odogaron can track the scent of their blood all the way to their final breath.[8] While it usually prowls the Rotten Vale, it has been observed venturing as far as the Coral Highlands to secure a meal.[3]\nOnce they have secured a kill, Odogaron will usually not immediately feast on, instead carrying it all the way back to their nest in the Vale. They do so by utilizing a network of tunnels that permeate the Vale, allowing Odogaron to quickly travel across the region while protecting their bounty. Once they arrive at their nests, Odogaron indulge in one of their more eccentric behaviors - they add their kill to a massive stockpile of meat. While storage like this makes sense for a creature with such a demanding metabolism, it has also been suggested that Odogaron intentionally dry age meat this way, as they seem to prefer the taste of carrion after it has sat around in a dry pile for some time.[3]\nOdogaron are also known to often carry a slab of meat with them while patrolling their habitats. This appears to be an insurance policy to have a quick bite if hunger sets in[3] and enter into the Full-body Flush at will for a quick power boost during challenging encounters.[9]",

Their wings have a unique, chain-like blade that can extend and retract freely to reap their prey.

Conversely, since their wings possess organs that absorb energy, a hunter can force the energy to leak out by focusing attacks there. Flooding them with continuous elemental attacks will eventually overload the organs, forcing the monster out of its enhanced state.Arkveld is a large quadrupedal Flying Wyvern that is covered in tough gray scales and snow-white furs. The scales are noted to be extremely hard while also having fairly brittle edges.[2] The fur meanwhile consists of strong intertwining strands that create a resistant mesh, further increasing the wyvern's defenses.[3] It appears to have tridactyl forelimbs, meaning it has three claws as the fourth and fifth digits seem to have developed into its chains. The hindlegs are zygodactyl with two toes in front and two rear, much like Seregios. Arkveld also has two facial protrusions that greatly resemble tusks, and has an upward cone-shaped nose (the Hunter's Guild seems to call these growths \"horns\" for the moment[4]). The creature\u2019s back is well armored, as it is covered with white scales that acts as a second layer of armor to prevent being attacked from the back by overlapping much like human made armor[5]. A large bump protrudes from the top of its back plates, which has been noted to sometimes attract lightning strikes during the Sandtide in Windward Plains. Its tail is rather flat, flexible, and covered with rocky plates, with incredibly thick muscles hidden beneath.[6]\nArkveld's most unique aspects are the chain-like structures extending from the lower segment of its front limb, comprised of rocky plates called Calloushells layered over highly flexible sinews that glow purple when active.[7] Although initially folded into a hard blade-like structure it can use to slash opponents, they can unfold into highly flexible whips that it can freely manipulate, allowing it to strike targets from afar, grab them, or pull itself towards surfaces. These whips house unique organs that can absorb elemental energy from their environment or other monsters, which Arkveld is able convert in to Dragon element for its own use. While Arkveld is sufficiently enraged and powered up, each whip splits in two and becomes charged with Dragon energy, allowing them to create explosive chain reactions. The elemental capacity of these organs can however be overloaded, causing harm to the wyvern and forcing it to rest and recover.[8]\nArkveld is able to feed directly on its absorbed energy, although it can also eat normally. It also has an unusual ability to absorb certain traits from monsters it preys on, which is the factor that is speculated to have altered the behavior of the Guardian Arkveld. Arkveld grows mysterious gems inside of its body, which are said to absorb life - if this is related to its element-draining properties is currently unknown.[9]",
        "behavior": "Arkveld often tends to its chain-like appendages, and can be seen grooming its chains with its mouth or claws. A behavior also seen in Arkveld is repeatedly rubbing and swirling its chains against the ground in an arc pattern as the sinews glow, leaving dark marks and scales on the ground, like drawing a crop circle. The intention of this action is unclear as of yet. Arkveld is highly wary of its surroundings, and often turns its head to look around as it goes about its day, even while eating. It seems nomadic in nature, can be found in any environment, and sleeps at no fixed spots in a given locale (e.g., in the Windward Plains, it can sleep in both the Doshaguma and Rey Dau nest).\nIt is highly aggressive towards both hunters and monsters, and if one wanders too close to Arkveld, it immediately picks a fight. It appears quite voracious, and will often immediately attempt to grapple and strangle potential prey with its chains before draining their energy. In the Ruins of Wyveria, it has been observed breaking open Guardian cocoons and devouring the dormant Guardians within.",

When its scales turn red hot, they will explode immediately and require caution, however, parts of the body will be soft too - the perfect time to attack.Bazelgeuse is a large Flying Wyvern that can be found in nearly any environment. Its back is covered with rock-like scutes, while the underside of its neck and tail sport protruding explosive scales. The \u201cblasting scales\u201d of the Bazelgeuse are not scales, rather they are formed by specialized glands located on the monster's neck and tail. These glands continuously secrete a unique fluid that hardens its exterior membrane, forming a blasting scale.[2] The scales can be dislodged from the Bazelgeuse's body, a process which happens naturally as the Bazelgeuse moves. When struck, jostled or simply exposed to the air for a long period of time, the scales detonate. Bazelgeuse is immune to the explosions caused by its own scales thanks to its incredibly resilient skin.[3] Even after scales are dropped, the glands continue to create new ones to ensure the monster always has access to its most powerful weapon.\nBazelgeuse's flight patterns are unique in that it relies primarily on gliding.[2] Its wings are sleek and wide, allowing it to glide silently while scouting for prey.\nThe teeth of Bazelgeuse are quite weak, and it lacks the bite force to tear tough hides. To compensate, the Bazelgeuse will pepper its food with its blasting scales to help break through the tough exterior of its prey.[2]",
        "behavior": "Bazelgeuse are infamous for their habit of swooping in on any ongoing conflict in their vicinity, viewing any area they inhabit as their territory. The monster sees any other large monster in its territory as potential competitors for food, driving it to attack until the trespassing monster leaves or dies.

Diablos have the ability to burrow underground and use this ability to strike from below, however, their sensitive ears make them susceptible to Sonic Bombs. Despite their predatory appearance, they are herbivorous and mostly feed on cactus.Diablos can be forcibly brought to the surface by using loud sounds. And its charging attack, while devastatingly powerful, can be baited into colliding with anthills, momentarily getting the Diablos stuck.Diablos are powerful herbivores that live almost exclusively in harsh deserts. They display the body plan typical of Flying Wyverns: Short torsos held by two digitigrade legs, two arms modified into wings, a long tail, and a head at the end of a neck that extends forward. Most of the scales are in shades of light brown and tan except for its white underside and grey legs. The neck, body, and tail are bulkier than most flying wyverns. The tail ends with a huge club made from two hemispheres of fused osteoderms and plates. The legs are somewhat short but very muscular. Large plates protect the thighs, and the four toes on its feet end in blunt dark claws. The arms of Diablos are muscular and covered in osteoderms. Two robust digits still function like normal fingers and sport blunt claws perfect for digging.\nThe most striking features of Diablos are their two massive horns. They are incredibly thick and protrude forward and outwards from the top of the skull. Then they curve inwards towards the midline and the tips curve upwards. The exact shape and angle of these horns varies by individual. Some shapes are rare - and more valuable - than others.[3] Diablos Horns grow throughout the Wyvern's life, and older individuals tend to have notably longer horns.[4]\nDiablos are protected by scaly plates that stay flat to the spine. On the sides, there is a line of dark gray osteoderms. The plates above the torso are the largest and slant upward. They are lined by blunt spikes similar to the frills. Larger scales protect the chest. This tan shell armor is extremely heavy and dense, providing ample defense against all manner of injury.[5] Continuous exposure to the harsh environments the Diablos live in and swirling sands hardens this shell as the Wyvern ages.[6] Some areas of the body can even harden so much that they receive a separate name: Diablos Carapace and Diablos Cortex.[7] The shell plate on Diablos' back is especially well developed, and is called a Ridge.[8] This immensely resistant plate is extremely sturdy and thus difficult to carve off.[9] Just like the rest of the shell, the Ridge of a Diablos also hardens over time, as sand and dust are baked onto it by the merciless sun. In the most extreme cases, these Ridges become near impenetrable - such Ridges are called Diablos Chine.[10]\nThe bone marrow of Diablos has powerful binding properties and can be used as an adhesive.[11] Like various other monsters, Diablos produce Dash Extract in their bodies to enhance their stamina.[12][13] The most valuable body part of a Diablos is its Diablos Medulla (sometimes also called a Blos Medulla). While extremely difficult to carve off without destroying it, this material is of great value to researchers.[14]\nLike many burrowing monsters, Diablos have poor vision but a strong sense of hearing.[15] Sonic Bombs will cause one to surface from the sand and flail as if it were in a pitfall trap. Ironically, the roar of a Diablos is loud and high-pitched, disturbing other burrowing monsters like Delex[16]. Diablos have the strength to reshape the landscape around them[15].",
        "behavior": "Diablos are entirely herbivorous and predominantly feed on various species of cacti.[17] When one Diablos invades the territory of another, they will lock horns to engage in a shoving match until one is knocked over or concedes.[18] Diablos spend most of their time in large caves that they, or other Diablos, have dug. Due to their sensitivity to sound, they rarely leave their cave except to feed. Diablos leave their caves five to six times daily to feed. It does not search for water because it acquires all its moisture from cacti. They feed on the same patches of cacti each day. This is either because they choose cacti with the most water or the cactus that tastes the best[19]. Being so dangerous, Diablos has very few predators.\nMated pairs of Diablos will share a territory, but when a female Diablos is in heat or pregnant, she will turn into a Black Diablos. Her aggression reaches even greater heights and she will treat her mate as an intruder[20].\nThe Diablos of the New World are even more aggressive than individuals in the Old World. However, they are unaware their biggest enemies are the Carrier Ants which feed on cacti without the wyvern noticing. There are times when the cacti patches shrink because of the ants, forcing the Diablos to expand its territory further. The First Wyverians call Diablos the \u201cLord of the Wildspire Waste\"[15].\nTheir excellent hearing makes Diablos quite sensitive to sounds. This includes natural sounds, such as the shriek of a startled Noios, which will cause Diablos to emerge from the sands violently.[21]",

The heat raises her body temperature for the development of her eggs[5]. The color lasts until the brooding season[4].\nAmong the many changes in the Black Diablos\u2019 behavior is her increased aggression. She may treat any creature as a threat to herself and attack accordingly. This aggression may even apply to her mate. A courted male and female will cohabit in a territory during the mating season. However, they will not cooperate in finding food or defense. The Black Diablos will instead engage in battle with the male as if they were fighting for territory. Sometimes one will break the other\u2019s horn. Despite her increased vigilance during the gestation period, it is not confirmed if female Diablos care for their young[5].\nFortunately, Black Diablos are reclusive. They do not leave their caves except for food[5]. Regular Diablos prefer cacti with the highest moisture content, as that is where they acquire all of their water[6]. Black Diablos instead choose cacti with the most nutrients for their young[5]. They visit the same cactus patches five to six times a day [6].\nBlack Diablos fight similarly to regular Diablos but with greater aggression and cunning. It has been noted to circle its target and wait for the right time to attack[7]. It will attack opponents from below just like a normal Diablos. However, Black Diablos may violently launch themselves from the ground instead of pulling themselves out like normal (Note: in games where Black Diablos is absent, normal Diablos may gain this attack). Black Diablos utilize new methods of charging at opponents. It can charge with greater speed and with little warning. It will lean its body to turn in an arc while charging. Its most dangerous attack is when it scratches the ground with its feet while tracking its target\u2019s movements. Then, it will suddenly charge as fast as possible[8].\nBesides her cunning, Black Diablos also possesses increased physical strength. Capable of smashing through rock and monster alike, Black Diablos dominate over their arid habitat. Their strength and aggression are enough to ward off powerful monsters such as Deviljho[5]. Individuals who become Tempered rival Elder Dragons in physical power [2].",

        "characteristics": "Threat: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Gigginox are bizarre flying wyvern that display some visual similarities to leeches. They have the general body plan of a flying wyvern, but are covered in a smooth, moist hide which is white on the top and bright red on the underside. The head and tail look quite similar, being bulbous masses of tissue that end in a small hole.This feature is believed to be defensive camouflage aimed at confusing enemies about which part of the body to attack.[6] Their wings and large and leathery. While they can be used to fly, Gigginox mostly use their wingarms for a quadruped gait, similar to monsters like Tigrex. They are also capable of sticking to and walking on cave walls and ceilings.\nThe hides of Gigginox display various unique properties. The underside is covered in fine hairs,[7] possibly to aid with the wyvern's ability to walk on walls. This ability is further enhanced by the hide's constant secretion of specialized body fluids with adhesive properties, allowing for en even more secure hold on various surfaces.[4] It is believed that these body secretions also help with maintaining body temperatures.[8] This hide develops over the wyvern's life, and fully developed ones can entirely negate scents and odors on contact.[9]\nThe most obvious feature of Gigginox hide is its ability to change color. When enraged, the hide of a Gigginox will take on a dark hue and harden significantly.[10] This color change appears to be a consequence of the wyvern's venom production increasing as it becomes agitated, temporarily altering the surface of the skin in the process.[8] Curiously, if the hide of a Gigginox is removed while in this altered state, it will remain darkened permanently. Hide scraps retrieved in these conditions are called Uncanny Hides.[11]\nGigginox' eyes are believed to have fully degenerated as a result of live in near perpetual darkness. They instead survey their surroundings through a specialized organ that allows them to sense and track heat.[10] The wyvern's maw is flexible and full of needle-like teeth used to gradually grind down prey.[12]\nA well-known and infamous feature of Gigginox is their ability to administer a powerful venom, either by spitting it out as a sludge or emitting it as a gas. This venom is produced in large, visible venom glands located on the head, abdomen and tail.[4] These glands filter out a portion of the wyvern's blood to synthesize it into venom.[8] As incredibly active organs, these glands never stop producing copious amounts of venom, using a specialized capillary system to circulate it across the entire body at all times. A notable quirk of Gigginox' venom glands is that they sometimes glow, which is especially noticeable in the dark. It is believed that this is bioluminescence resulting from the biochemical reaction that turns its blood into venom. The glow might also serve as a threat display.[4]\nGigginox are believed to be close relatives of Khezu.[13]",
        "behavior": "Gigginox have so far only been sighted living in the Tundra.\nThese predatory wyvern hunt by detecting prey through their body heat and then incapacitating them with poison.[10] Once poisoned, prey is dragged into the Gigginox' cave and left to freeze solid, which is believed to function like a kind of cold storage.[4] This also has an additional benefit: The various corpses frozen into cave walls present a curiosity for other monsters to investigate, thus luring more prey into the clutches of the Gigginox.[8]\nOutside of hunting, Gigginox spend most of their time sleeping while sticking to walls or ceilings, displaying an overall low level of activity.[4] They are generally solitary, but have been observed tolerating the presence of other Gigginox on occasion.[14] During especially harsh seasons, adolescent Gigginox have also been seen banding together and building large cocoon colonies to keep each other warm during their slumbers.[8]\nGigginox are hermaphrodites and reproduce asexually.[8] They are extremely fertile and can lay eggs near constantly, depositing them in large gelatinous sacs that hatch quickly.[10] Gigginox hatchlings are called Giggi and will seek out moist sheltered areas to protect the mucus layer on their sensitive skins.[8] While adults are only found in the Tundra, Giggi have been sighted in a large variety of biomes. It is believed that the high spawn rate of this species pushes juveniles to explore new territories.[4] The Hunter's Guild expects to eventually discover various Subspecies of Gigginox that have adapted to all the different environments these juveniles venture into.[8]",

After using an electric shock to paralyze their prey, they extend their long neck and pounce.The Khezu will cling to walls or the ceiling to unleash its electric attacks from above. Use Wiredash to get to it and knock it down, or exhaust it to weaken its electricity.Khezu is a unique, pale flying wyvern, characterized by its long and elastic neck, which it uses to snatch prey while climbing on the ceiling of caves. Their body is generally plump with layers of fat, and unlike many monsters in the series, is not covered in scales, but in slimy flabby skin. [2] Eerily, its eyes have completely degenerated from its cavernous lifestyle,[2] and it lacks any ears or nostrils; only equipped with a single large mouth like leeches, marked with light red lips. When open, it reveals several unruly rows of triangular teeth placed in their large gums. It possesses a large round body, covered in a white pearlescent hide. From head to toe, the skin is plastered with pulsing veins of blue and red, with prominent arteries lined in its chest. Its back spine protrudes, making a noticeable ridge bump. It has regular-sized wings, used to climb walls and ceilings, but also fly short distances. The wing membranes are of a flesh-pink, and their 5 digits have nail-like claws that are of a sickly yellow. The third finger is conjoined with the fourth, similar to bird wings. It lacks talons and instead has webbed feet, together with suction pad toes like frogs, making wet platting sounds everytime it walks. Its short, stubby tails end in an extra orifice that are also lined with smaller teeth, which open up and \"bite\" onto the floor when using most of its electric abilities, as well as using it to hang from the ceiling.[1]\nLike the Gypceros tail, Khezu's neck is rubbery and elastic, able to reach twice its body length, and is used for combat and eating. It can catch foes off guard with how long its neck can extend, and swoops its head around to knock them out. It is able to do this because most its neck vertebrae are made of cartilage, along with powerful muscles and flexible blood vessels.[1] Occasionally, it flies into the air to get through a cave shortcut, but they often use their wing claws and webbed feet to grip and crawl to other locations. Although it has no visible nostrils, it has a knack for smelling because of olfactory receptors around its mouth and is commonly seen sniffing its surroundings. It also utilises electroreception, which is where its moist hide comes to play. By using ambient humidity, it can 'see' targets when detecting electric signals from bodies, which is especially useful when Khezu lives in the cold wet caves. Inside its body is a thunder organ, capable of amplifying attacks with electricity and spitting electric projectiles. It can use these to paralyse its prey for an easy meal. When enraged, Khezu's veins and blood vessels start pulsating even faster, becoming more red. It is slow in its attacks, yet very sporadic. It can surround itself in thunder element, pushing away pesky opponents. It also likes to cry out its infamous roar, stunning anything around it.",
        "behavior": "Khezus are cave dwellers, frequently living in chilly locales like the Swamp and Frost Islands, specifically located near active sources of water to conduct electricity into their prey and maintain their damp skin.[4] Although they inhabit caves, they go out when they please, or when food inside grows too scarce. Outside the caves, they are vulnerable to larger Wyverns like Tigrex, who usually hang in the same areas as Khezu, but inside the caves, Khezu have the advantage as they are unhampered by the dark. Any sort of small animal will do for its diet, but it loves the typical Kelbi, as often seen in its ecological videos. It is not very hostile, due to the fact that it has no eyes and has to be near the vicinity of a hunter or monster to detect it. If the wyvern cannot detect prey, it will quite literally remain blind to their presence. Khezu are ambush predators, lying in wait near underground water sources or cave entrances waiting for unweary prey to enter their domain.[4] Thus, when walking past a Khezu, it likely would ignore you. However, if wandering too close, it will hunt you down. As they are not competitive or aggressive creatures, they do not have many turf wars and are not usually the apex of their area, often wandering only in caverns. Essentially, Khezu are not powerful monsters in their food chain and can often struggle to survive from other creatures like Zamtrios and Tigrex. Nerscylla, specifically its Shrouded subspecies, specializes in preying on Khezu and will wear their skin after eating the unfortunate wyvern. Khezu can sometimes be seen feasting on leftover corpses.\nAs hermaphrodites, Khezus are both male and female. They grow babies in their tail and to reproduce, and paralyze a warm-blooded creature with their electric spit and inject their young, known as Whelps. The Whelps grow inside their victim until it dies, or when they are strong enough to leave, similar to real-life parasitic creatures like the Tarantula Hawk.\nKhezu's neck muscles weaken as they grow older, and their heads begin to droop. Once they reach a certain age where their heads are too weak to catch prey, they die.[4]\nKhezu are also hypothesised to be the subspecies of the actual original but rarer Red Khezu, and their white skin may just be an albino genetic mutation, coincidentally landing them a better spot in the ecosystem as they can camouflage in the snowy areas they live in.",

        "characteristics": "An azure-colored subspecies of Rathalos. More mobile than their standard cousins, they locate prey from the air and quickly swoop in for the kill.Azure Rathalos largely resemble the common Rathalos species, but display a few noteworthy differences.\nThe most obvious change is the coloration: Azure Rathalos are covered in a blue shell and sport green wing membranes, the exact shade of which can vary drastically between regional populations. Why and how this coloration came to be is still debated, but one hypothesis that has been brought forth suggests that it might be related to camouflage. The blue shell of an Azure Rathalos would make it blend into the skies when viewed from below, and the green membranes might help it not stick out when grounded in a forest.[4]\nThe shell is however not merely altered in color. It has also been noted to be much tougher than the red shells of common Rathalos, especially around the wings. This near adamantine armor offers superior protection and is also very heat resistant - a trait believed to enable the Azure Rathalos' extended presence in volcanic regions.[5]\nThe wings of Azure Rathalos are quite muscular and allow them to rule over the skies even better than their crimson relative.[5] They are excellent fliers, and the added armor on the wing arms and sturdier wing membranes reduce the risk of injury to the wings.[6]\nLike their common relatives, Azure Rathalos possess both venom glands and fire sacs, which are used for poisonous talon swipes and flaming breath attacks respectively. The flame breath of Azure Rathalos is noted to be more variable in strength, with its potency increasing as the wyvern becomes angrier. This seems to be linked to an expansion of the lungs, resulting in increasingly violent air flow and temperature within the flame organs.[7]\nTheir increased physical strength and airborne agility do seem to come at a cost; Azure Rathalos have been observed slumping to the ground in exhausting after prolonged battle, implying reduced endurance and stamina compared with the common species.[5]\nWhich of these theories is likelier and what might have led to the evolution of Old World Azure Rathalos is currently unknown.",
        "behavior": "Azure Rathalos are consistently noted to be much more aggressive and irritable than the common Rathalos.[2] They have also been observed dominating and harassing their red relatives[5] and are believed to have an instinctual aggression towards them.[2] When engaging an enemy, Azure Rathalos attempt to overwhelm them with long combos of airborne attacks.[6]\nAzure Rathalos pair up with Pink Rathian.[2] In the New World, Azure Rathalos spend most of the year in the Elder's Recess, but move down south to meet Pink Rathian and reproduce during the Mating Season. This migration is believed to be due to the fact that the sweltering heat and extreme competition in the Recess would make it a poor nesting ground, as it would pose a substantial risk to the hatchlings.[7]",

The scales and shells of a Dreadqueen are a dark green with purple hues, quite unlike the pure green seen in normal Rathian. The tail tip is also much spikier, growing larger and denser bundles of spines.\nDreadqueen Rathian appear to have a highly increased rate of poison production, and the poison created in their bodies is also several degrees more deadly than regular Rathian poison. This improved poison can also hang around in the air in gaseous form after it has been expelled. The tail spikes also detach from the tail tip quite easily, impaling the ground and oozing out both liquid and gaseous poison into their immediate surroundings.[3] A Dreadqueen's poison production is so extreme that the compounds leak into every part of its body, seeping into its shell and oozing from the gaps between its scales - this is believed to be the reason for their coloration.[4] As a result, Dreadqueen Scales are incredibly poisonous to the touch[5] and can only be handled by highly skilled blacksmiths.[6]",

It has adapted to the Sandtide - when it most frequently appears - and is able to store, amplify and discharge the storm's heavy lightning to lethal effect. Rey Dau is highly territorial and will attack any and all intruders on sight. The fulgurite against its carapace emits a sound that puts every monster in the region on guard.\nHelpful Hints: When a Rey Dau's wing or tail touches the ground while charged, it causes a reaction that produces a mantle of fulgurite. Not only does this widen the appendage's attack range, but it also increases the monster's charging capacity - so make a point of breaking these parts. Their heads may also be vulnerable after a discharge attack. Hunters are advised to bring thunder-resistant armor and water-based weaponry.Rey Dau primarily fights by slashing and slamming their wings, which can be done from both the ground and the air. Its horns can be folded in front of its face, allowing for charged stabs and firing off bolts of lightning. As it uses physical attacks with its wings and tail, these parts will become coated in Fulgurite crystals, increasing the range of its electrical attacks. These crystals can be shattered off their body with enough damage. Rey Dau's tail can not be coated in Fulgurite if it is severed.\nEventually Rey Dau will charge up its body with electricity, causing its horns to glow brightly and its wings and tail to immediatley become coated in Fulgurite glass. This state allows Rey Dau to fire even deadly lightning bolts, however they can be knocked out of it by dealing enough damage to the Fulgurite crystals covering their body.\nWhile in its nest in Area 17, Rey Dau's electrically charged attacks will electrify the Fulgurite lining the ground, creating delayed aftershocks. However, the area has a pillar that can be pulled down to generate Grounding Pod ammo for the slinger (and damage Rey Dau), allowing one to temporarily neutralize the ground's ability to conduct electricity.\nRey Dau is immune to Great Thunderbugs and Shock Traps due to its adaptations to the Sandtide and its lightning.\nAfter their charged lightning beams, Rey Dau's folded out horns become a weak point for Focus Strikes.

Not only does this widen the appendage's attack range, but it also increases the monster's charging capacity - so make a point of breaking these parts. Their heads may also be vulnerable after a discharge attack. Hunters are advised to bring thunder-resistant armor and water-based weaponry.The Rey Dau is the largest Flying Wyvern wherein flight capabilities are not reduced, distinguishing it from other giant species such as Barioth or Diablos, and is exceeded in wingspan only by the Bazelgeuse. The yellow shells covering the length of the head, body, forearm, talons, and thigh are adorned by enlarged, backward-facing spines protruding from the sides and center; the length of these spines and overall shape of the shells varies considerably between arrangements. They are highly conductive, and react with the Fulgurite dust in its environment to form a coat of armor that produces a distinct, threatening sound when the spines scrape against each other during motion.[2][3][4]\nIts skull is stout and short, and characterised by two pairs of horns, which are covered in an armor of conductive carapace and supported by powerful muscles at their base that allow them to be moved freely.[5] The primary pair grows from the sides of the cranium and points outward at rest, while the smaller secondary pair is attached to the mandibles and points forward. By folding the primary horns over its snout, a Rey Dau is able to utilize them as a thrusting weapon or discharge large amounts of stored electricity, producing powerful lightning strikes.[6] A set of spined, deep indigo scales line the side of the Rey Dau's neck, which extrude and glow when large amounts of electricity are channeled to the Monster's horns for an attack.\nLike certain other Flying Wyvvern species such as the Rathian and Rathalos, the Rey Dau feeds by tearing chunks of flesh from its prey using its beaked jaws while restraining it with its anisodactyl hindfeet. The four toes on each foot are slender and muscular, with the three facing forward curling so that only the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints touch the ground when walking, while the proportionally shorter, backward-facing toe is straight, and only touches the ground with the tip. The talons on the foreward facing toes are thin and curved, with the middle toe having the largest, followed by the straight claw on the backward toe, then those on the outer, and then inner.\nThe forelimbs of the Rey Dau are two fingered, of which the primary forms an exceptionally large enlongated talon, while the other serves as the attachment point for its wing membrane. This membrane is decorated by a striking pattern of dark blue stripes, with the yellow deepening to orange at its length, and unlike in many other Flying Wyrens is not supported by any additional fingers or rods of cartilage or bones. The talon is sheathed in sharp protruding scales that form a blade on its edge.\nThe tail is long, and coated in particularly large, spiked scales, with the largest pair forming a fork at the tailend. When the talons and tail are dragged are charged with electricity and dragged through the sands, a reaction occurs that fuses Fulgurite to the scales, forming a mantle of jagged armor that enhances Rey Dau's electrical charging capacity further and enlarges the coated appendages.[7][2]\nA Rey Dau's entire body is highly conductive to electricity, a trait in part owed to the complex patterns and shapes found in its scales and carapace, but while the discharged electricity originates from its organs, it's unclear if the Monster itself is capable of producing any significant amounts by itself, or absorbs it all from the powerful thunderstorms that characterize the Sandtide.[3][4] Notably, the Rey Dau is completely unaffected by outside sources of electricity.",
        "behavior": "Rey Dau is extremely territorial and instantly aggressive towards any intruders in its turf, attacking them on sight.\nRay Dau appears to hunt primarily during the Sandtide, the Inclemency period of the Windward Plains, and can be seen snatching Ceratonoth away to its nest. Due to its power and aggression, Monsters endemic to the region are deterred by the noise produced by its coat of Fulgurite armor alone.",

Sometimes the large monster you're hunting will get sucked into a Balahara sand pit...but there's nothing stopping you from going after it.Balahara is a serpentine, worm-like Leviathan with a slender beige body covered in hard black scales and padded shells, grown through the absorption of Fulgurite present in its habitat.[2] It has four stubby limbs and a drill-like tail that it uses to propel itself at great speeds through sand and stab at enemies.[3] Its head is pointed and covered in larger shells, while its jaw has a unique tripartite structure that folds outwards when opening its mouth, with numerous sharp teeth resembling drill bits used for mining, and rows of blue, eye-like sensory organs lining the edges. These \"eyes\" are capable of normal sight, although it primarily relies on senses like hearing and smell in low-light environments, such as caves or sandstorms.\nThe insides of their throat have a luminescent bluish-teal glow, provided by the bacteria in the mucus they secrete; this is believed to aid their visibility during sandstorms or tunneling. This mucus is also expelled from its mouth as a means to attack, resembling a dark blackish-green fluid when not glowing, and coats its body to give it more maneuverability.\nUsing its flexible skeleton and powerful tail, Balahara is able to maneuver around uneven terrain and swiftly tunnel through sand and bedrock, protected by its hard scales and skull.[4][5] It is also able to loosen the sand it digs through and create pits of quicksand that can trap prey and suck them below the surface.\nBalahara take ore into their bodies through unknown means, and refine it over the course of many years into lustrous black pearls.[6]",
        "behavior": "Balahara appear to be ambush predators who lure their prey into quicksand traps and suck them into their lairs to be devoured, although they have also been seen actively pursuing prey. They have been observed hunting both by themselves and in larger packs. Balahara appear to be more active during the Fallow and Sandtide compared to the Plenty.",

You'll need to watch out for those tail claws, but handle an attack well to turn it into a counterstrike opportunity. Destroying the membrane on their necks will lower their guards while aloft. Furthermore, you can target the membrane wound to knock them out of their air, making this a prime target.Hirabami are medium sized purple leviathans with long, flat bodies, and speckled teal spots on their greyish underbellies. Their stubby forelegs have small fins on the lower half and terminate in two talons each, one being greatly elongated and hook-like, while their hind legs are spindly and have webbed digits. The monster primarily slithers to move around on land, only using its small limbs for leverage or grip. Their bodies are extremely flexible, being able to contort, fold, and roll up with no difficulty, while their pliable cloth-like purple hide has insulating properties.[2] They are known to periodically shed their skin, leaving behind the remains as Hirabami Moltings.\nHirabami have pointed, bony heads with beady yellow eyes, along with a tripartite jaw that folds outwards when they open their mouths. The insides of their mouths are teal in color and lined with many sets of small, blunt teeth, and have a tube-like orifice at the bottom, from which Hirabami can spit a freezing fluid to immobilize prey.\nHirabami have a two-layered elastic membrane on their neck that is able to flare out into a large hood-like structure.[3] When expanded, this lightweight membrane catches and modulates the strong wind currents in their habitats, allowing them to hover in place and fly through the air.[4] They can maintain stable flight even in extreme weather,[5] but even in regions without strong wind, like the Wounded Hollow, Hirabami still demonstrate the ability to hover relatively freely. Their scales are sturdy yet small and extremely light, aiding their ability to float.[6]\nThe Hirabami's flat, ribbonlike tail accounts for the majority of its body length, and has a teal underside lined with many rows of pincer-like claws, which oscillate like swimmerets while folded. At the end of its tail are several pairs of much larger barbed claws which serve as the Hirabami's main means of hunting, with it using them to immobilize and cut apart prey.[7]",
        "behavior": "Hirabami are pack hunters, often surrounding prey in groups of 3. They will also nest in groups by clinging to surfaces using their scales or foreclaws as they sleep.[4]\nThey are known to get into territorial disputes with other predators in the Iceshard Cliffs, such as Blangonga and Jin Dahaad.",

        "hunter_notes": "A leviathan that sits at the peak of the Iceshard Cliffs' ecosystem. It surrounds its massive form in cold temperatures via ridge-like cooling organs across its body; the frost its limbs produce doubles as a potent weapon and a way to travel along walls and floating rocks.\nHelpful Hints: Every part of Jin Dahaad's massive body is capable of powerful freezing attacks. Diminish their offensive capabilities by attacking the ridges that they use for cooling. The largest ridges on their back are particularly powerful and should be destroyed, but the hide there is very tough unless the other ridges are dealt with first.The battle with Jin Dahaad takes place over three (four in its proper quest) areas that it moves between at health intervals. The first and second areas are largely nondescript, with Jin Dahaad using powerful physical attacks from their forelimbs and tail that kick up icy debris around them, as well as ice breath attacks from its mouth, with it being able to use more powerful ice breaths from the second area onwards. The second area will always have three resting Hirabami that, if awakened, will interfere with the fight by attacking Jin Dahaad for a brief time before leaving.\nThe four iceplates distributed across their body (Cranial, Abdominal, Tail and Large) can be broken. Breaking their Large, Abdominal and Tail iceplates will weaken their forelimbs, hindlimbs and tail's ability to release freezing air respectively. The Large Iceplate will be frozen over and nearly immune to damage until all three other Iceplates are broken, with breaking it additionally disabling their use of their nova. Attacking and breaking Jin Dahaad's legs can knock it down and allow better access to the iceplates. Players that deal enough damage to Jin Dahaad will draw its aggro, indicated by a red line connecting them to the monster similar to that caused by a Luring Pod.\nIn the third area, there will be several collapsible walls that can be brought down onto Jin Dahaad , floating rubble that can be knocked down to damage Jin Dahaad and provide temporary cover from its attacks, and several crumbling structures that Jin Dahaad can climb onto before launching ice breath attacks. The crumbling structures will gradually weaken as Jin Dahaad  clings to them, until they can be collapsed with the slinger's claw to send Jin Dahaad falling back down for massive damage and a knockdown. It will also periodically use a special attack where it begins sucking in air, dealing continuous chip damage to hunters, before releasing a zone-spanning ice explosion that deals immense damage. Hunter can avoid this attack by dropping the rubble from the top of the arena and using it as cover from the blast.\nIn its Slay quest, Jin Dahaad will move to a fourth area once its health is low enough. This area is largely the same as the third except lacking the crumbling walls. Jin Dahaad uses a similar moveset to its third phase, but behaves more aggressively and gains a new attack where it crystallizes its surroundings, inflicting Frostblight.\nUnusually for a non-Elder Dragon, Jin Dahaad cannot be captured. It remains vulnerable to Shock Traps, but is immune to Pitfall Traps.\nJin Dahaad has numerous weak points for Focus Strikes that appear at specific points in time:",
        "classification": "Leviathan",
        "sightings": "Jin Dahaad is only found in the Iceshard Cliffs, and is primarily active in the Frostwinds, although it can rarely be found during other weather conditions. Interaction with Jin Dahaad in the Cliffs is limited, as it will lean over a cliffside and launch attacks at hunters and other monsters, leaving if hunters damage it enough. If Jin Dahaad is repelled like this and the player is eligible for the quest, they can pursue Jin Dahaad to the Rimechain Peak to begin a quest. Jin Dahaad can also appear at the Rimechain Peak itself, upon which players can directly start an Investigation for it from the menu.",

        "characteristics": "Hunters Notes: A leviathan that sits at the peak of the Iceshard Cliffs' ecosystem. It surrounds its massive form in cold temperatures via ridge-like cooling organs across its body; the frost its limbs produce doubles as a potent weapon and a way to travel along walls and floating rocks.\nHelpful Hints: Every part of Jin Dahaad's massive body is capable of powerful freezing attacks. Diminish their offensive capabilities by attacking the ridges that they use for cooling. The largest ridges on their back are particularly powerful and should be destroyed, but the hide there is very tough unless the other ridges are dealt with first.Jin Dahaad is a gargantuan serpentine monster covered in a gnarled grey hide, with articulated ridges resembling copper or bronze covering the majority of its body, the largest of which can freely fold in and out. A large crest of these ridges adorns its head, which is fairly flat in shape and has a tripartite jaw structure that folds outwards when the monster opens its mouth. It has a set of massive ridges protruding from its back, as well as a protruding ribbed chest structure terminating in several bony spikes. Each of its claws has smaller ridges and a spike in the palm position that Jin Dahaad uses to dig into terrain and anchor itself. Its tail is long and slender, with more metallic ridges at their base and tip, along with flat spines running along its length and a rake-like structure at the tip. Although mostly concealed by the ridges on its head, Jin Dahaad has beady black eyes, each surrounded by several more structures that resemble additional eyes but are currently unknown in nature.\nThe large coppery ridges on Jin Dahaad's body, known as Iceplates, are layered structures made of a metallic material with an extreme ability to absorb and retain heat,[2] to the point that they continue to chill the surroundings when separated from the monster.[3] The Iceplates serve as heat sinks for the monster; by absorbing heat and channeling it to the ridges, which retain it and vent it into the surrounding air, Jin Dahaad can dramatically lower the temperature of its body and the immediate surroundings. The amount of heat shunted to the Iceplates causes them to glow incandescently when the monster is cooling itself, with the ridges constantly emitting steam even when not active; in spite of this, the Iceplates are never seen melting or deforming, although the largest ones are visibly tinted teal, presumably from heat-induced oxidation.\nBy using its cooling abilities, Jin Dahaad produces and expels massive amounts of supercooled air and frost from its mouth and various vents along its body (notably its chest, lower body, tail, and claws), allowing it to nearly instantly freeze its surroundings. In addition to its serpentine body allowing it to coil around terrain or structures, it also utilizes its cooling abilities to freeze its limbs to surfaces on contact, acting as a form of adhesion that helps it freely climb on uneven terrain and walls despite its enormous size and weight.[4]\nThe metallic nature of Jin Dahaad's scales prevent them from freezing despite the cold of its environment and abilities,[5] while its carapace is as tough as steel yet doesn't impede its movement at all.[6] Its claws are so cold that they are said to immediately freeze anything they touch.[7]",
        "behavior": "Jin Dahaad is highly territorial and does not take kindly to intruders in its turf, pursuing them relentlessly once they enter. Once angered, it is tenacious to the point that even severe injury is not enough to deter it from hunting down the offenders. When engaging a target in combat, Jin Dahaad violently rattles the cooling ridges on its head and back in a gesture akin to intimidation.\nJin Dahaad appears to descend to the Iceshard Cliffs to hunt only during the Frostwinds, the Inclemency period of the Iceshard Cliffs.",

Instead, these are elderly Lagiacrus that have grown too large and heavy to venture onto land. As a result, these old individuals moved into the sea permanently, their bodies changing and adapting to dark depths over untold years of fully aquatic life.[2]\nThese changes manifest most prominently in the leviathan's coloration - Abyssal Lagiacrus are jet-black, blending into the dark sea. Despite their dark surface however, the scales of Abyssal Lagiacrus have been noted to give off an eerie, unearthly glow.[3] Its dark body is illuminated by a constant stream of electricity that flows across the monster's body. Like with the regular species, this charge seems to be concentrated on the Abyssal Lagiacrus' Deathly Shockers on its back. These organs are more powerful than their counterparts on the regular species, and are said to be able to electrify entire seas.[4] The origin of this perpetual electric charge is however believed to be a separate organ, called a Dynamo, which is only found in the bodies of Abyssal Lagiacrus. How exactly it functions is unknown, but it appears to supply the leviathan with nearly endless electric energy.[5]",

If you are inflicted with bubbleblight, you'll be left open for longer after taking an attack, so fix yourself up quickly with a cleanser.Mizutsune are large quadruped leviathans known for their fox-like appearance and strange bubble based abilities. They have four large pink fins and two smaller ones decorating their whiskered faces, purple fur coating the bottom of their body and tail, and rows of pink dorsal fins on their back. The large fins on its head can change color as a result of the large number of blood vessels within, such as turning red when the monster is enraged or blue when it is fatigued.\nMizutsune scales are partially transparent, and their uneven shape refracts light in various different colors.[3] Over the leviathan's life, the scales fall off and are replaces by newly formed ones. Mizutsune scales that remain on their bodies for a long time become polished and smooth by the monster's body fluids and increase in value proportionally.[4] It is said that only a single scale on an individual Mizutsune's body remains for its entire life, and that such a scale is so polished that the light it reflects creates rainbows in the sky.[1]\nThe most distinctive physiological feature of Mizutsune is their unique synovial fluid, which is produced in specialized glands all over the body. By mixing these fluids with water in their surroundings and moisture stuck to their bodies, Mizutsune create a foamy, soapy substance that they can use for various purposes. They can cover their bodies in a thin layer of it, giving the leviathans body a slippery surface that enhances its agility and allows it to glide elegantly across all kinds of terrain. The foam mixture also causes Mizutsune to be surrounded by various large bubbles at most times, which form naturally as the substance is mixed and dispersed by the monster's fur. These bubbles can incapacitate foes by popping near them and covering them in soap, causing them to slip and fall uncontrollably. The bubbles also serve as sensory enhancers - the many whiskers of Mizutsune are attuned to sense and hear the movements and poppings of the bubbles, expanding the range of their hearing and allowing them to enforce large territories.[1] Mizutsune can also store water within their bodies and spray pressurized streams or blasts of it from their mouths.\nThe large-finned individuals commonly sighted by the Guild have been discovered to be male Mizutsune, while females of the species are noted to have smaller fins.[1]",
        "behavior": "These leviathans are quite voracious, and have been noted to eat copious amounts of fish by swallowing them whole. Due to this voraciousness, Mizutsune ingest not just fish, but all other things their prey fish might themselves have eaten. This leads to an incredibly varied diet by proxy, and is theorized to be linked to the production of the leviathan's unique synovial fluid.[1]\nMizutsune are known to engage in territorial disputes, especially with Zinogre, as the species share many habitats.[1] They usually have a calm disposition, but males of the species are known to become highly aggressive during the mating season.[5]",

You can dodge their wave with some creative evading, or by using things like Wedge Beetles to escape upward.Uth Duna primarily uses slow, powerful physical attacks with its claws and belly. With their water veil up, and while submerged in deep waters, these attacks are augmented by waves that push the hunter away from Uth Duna, with the more powerful waves also being capable of dealing damage.\nUth Duna begins to fight covered in a veil of water. These veils are considered separate from the monster itself, and do not damage Uth Duna when attacked. However, dealing enough damage can break them individually, weakening Uth Duna's defenses. Destroying enough of them will dispel the rest and briefly knock the monster over, but without them weighing it down, its speed and aggression will increase significantly. Uth Duna will restore its veils after enough time has passed without them, damaging and pushing back Hunters caught in the resulting explosion.\nWhile within its lair in Area 17, Uth Duna will be able to swim in the deep waters of the reservoir, performing acrobatic leaps that create particularly powerful waves. Several Wedge Beetles present at the edge of the reservoir allow Hunters to avoid them, and a pair of Loch Ruins in the water can be torn down onto the Uth Duna when it swims past using the Slinger's claw, damaging the Monster considerably and forcing it back into the shallows, where it will be momentarily toppled. Another ruin situated over the deeper portion of the river in Area 13 can be collapsed on top of Uth Duna when it travels between Areas 15 and 12, with the same effect.\nAfter performing their leaping belly flop, Uth Duna's mouth will become a weak point for Focus Strikes.",

It has adapted to water-rich environments and is sighted most often during the Downpour.

You can dodge their wave with some creative evading, or by using things like Wedge Beetles to escape upward.Similar to the Nibelsnarf and Gobul, the Uth Duna is robust and stout in build, rather than slender and elongated as is typical for a Leviathan. The torso is broad and long, and undulates when swimming, appearing to be its primary means of propulsion, whereas the horizontally triangular tail is proportionally short and thick, with almost an third of the Leviathan's impressive length being owed to the long cilia growing from its tail and the tentacles on its shoulders, which extend long over the tail when not suporting its water veil.\nThe skull is flat and V-shaped, and uniquely among Leviathans, the jaws are able to protrude from the mouth. Unlike the skull, they are U-Shaped, and the mandible is longer than the maxilla, ending in a long, pointed chin.  Like the Nibelsnarf and Hirabami, Uth Duna possess gill-like structures situated at the sides of its head, which are covered by a developed gill-flap. The eye is lidless and covered in a milky white membrane, and like in most Monsters, shines in the dark, suggesting the presence of a tapetum lucidum for enhanced night vision.\nMost of the body is covered in a pattern of red and blue cycloid scales, which is separated from the light grey-brown belly by a thick band of black scales. The hindlimbs and skull are black in colouration as well, with yellow stripes decorating the gill-flaps and area around the Monster's eye. The scales are cycloid in shape, and thinly grooved to enhance water retention.[2]\nPairs of long, fleshy tentacles lined with long strands of wiry light-blue cilia protrude from the Uth Duna's skull, shoulders, and forehand, which support a veil of gelatinous fluid composed of water and a substance produced in its body.[3] The ones situated at the shoulder are almost longer than the body itself, and support a pair of veils that run across the sides of the back to the hip. The second longest pair are the ones growing from the skull, where the veils run across the length of the neck to above the shoulders. The tentacles on the forehand are the shortest, and the veil runs along the length of the arm, along the side of the belly, and to the hindleg.\nThe forehands possess four broad, developed fingers, with the fifth digits appearing to form the base of the tentacles, while the hindfeet are long, with five short, thick toes. The claws on the fingers are tough and curved, allowing the Leviathan to anchor itself amidst strong water currents and climb up waterfalls.[4]\nThe cilia grow from the Uth Duna's body in different lengths and arrangements. The longest are found on the tentacles and tail, are ordered into thin rows, and support the length and width of the water veil, ending at the depressions between the teardrop shapes on its rim. Shorter, curly cilia grow in thick bands on the tail tip, forearms, sides of the belly, and portions of the tentacles, forming a woven mesh to which the water veil anchors.[5]\nThe gelatinous fluid forming the veil is tough and heavy, which protects the Uth Duna's body and increases its mass and surface area. When it becomes destroyed, the tentacles growing from the skull and shoulders are folded up against its body and the cilia bound into a long, false tail, mitigating the risk of them being damaged.[5] The tentacles on the forehands are not retracted, and the attaching cilia form a tangled mesh vaguely resembling wing membranes. Due to their length, the shoulder tentacles extend a short distance over the tail when folded.",
        "behavior": "Uth Duna primarily appears during the Downpour, emerging from the deep waters of the loch to patrol the forest growing beneath.\nIt will attack other Large Monsters and packs of Piragills upon finding them within its territory, but exhibits no aggression towards Gajios. Uth Duna feeds on large predatory fish such as Gajau or Great Trevally, which are ambushed from below and eaten underwater. Due to the high speeds achieved in the attack, the Leviathan will breach from the water, launching its victim into the air before catching it in its protruding jaws.",

The elongated body of the Najarala is adorned with a thick carapace of green shells. The hide beneath the hardened carapace is surprisingly smooth and flexible.[3] It has four relatively short legs, its forelimbs slightly longer than its hind legs. The skull of the Najarala is stout, adorned with large fangs and a curved beak. The monster's tail tapers into a fan-like shape at the tip, from which it can shoot resonating scales.\nThe shells on its neck protrude outwards and form a sail-like shape that, when rubbed together, vibrate the surrounding air and produce powerful soundwaves.[1] The strength of the soundwaves produced by the vibrations of the monster's scales is amplified by the unique acoustic properties of the protruding shells on its neck, called sounders.[4] Najarala can also shoot resonating scales at enemies from its tail, which burst due to the sympathetic vibration caused by the monster's roars or the rattling of its shells.[1][5]\nThe Najarala's beak boasts two enlarged fangs, along with a row of smaller, needle-like teeth. The fangs contain a powerful, highly-concentrated neurotoxin that induces paralysis.[6] These toxins are also found in the monster's bone marrow, which can also cause paralysis if handled improperly.[7]\nDespite its extremely large size, the Najarala is quite agile and bendy thanks to the flexible skin hidden underneath its thick plating[3] and its surprisingly adept limbs. The plates on the monster's body come in various sizes to ensure that it can slither around with ease.[8] Najarala's short legs come with surprising strength, able to support the monster's weight while it is standing upright.\nThere have been sightings of Najarala with colour variations reported to the Hunter's Guild. It has been theorized that Najarala that live in certain habitats have varying colours due to dietary differences, however, the existence of these colour variations is unconfirmed.[1]",
        "behavior": "The Najarala is an ambush predator. It attacks unsuspecting prey by burrowing underground and ambushing them from beneath their feet, or by launching resonating scales to catch prey unawares. Once its prey is stunned, the Najarala wraps its serpentine body around them and constricts them to death.[5] Najarala prey on small monsters such as Slagtoth.\nThese Snake Wyverns appear to be quite intelligent and will target stunned enemies.[9]",

        "characteristics": "Threat: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Shrouded Nerscylla closely resemble common Nerscylla. They are large, six-eyed Temnoceran with six legs, four of which are used for walking while the anterior two limbs are modified into hooked pedipalps. Like the common species, Shrouded Nerscylla also possess massive extendable chelicerae doused in venom.\nA distinguishing feature of this subspecies is its coloration - its shell is black with purple nodes around the joints, and blue accents on the underside.[2] Just as with the regular species, the true shell of a Shrouded Nerscylla is often hidden by the skin of other monsters, which the Temnoceran wears as a cloak. While common Nerscylla generally use the hides of Gypceros for this to benefit from their thunder resistant skin, Shrouded Nerscylla are generally seen wearing the skin of a Khezu.[2] The purpose of this is believed to be related to moisture retention, as the wet hide of Khezu can protect the Shrouded Nerscylla from drying out in the desert while also reflecting sunlight due to its color.[5] It has been suggested that Shrouded Nerscylla may wear other monster skins too depending on regional variations.[2]\nWhile Shrouded Nerscylla display the same venomous bite of the common species, the large crystal spikes on their backs are quite different, being a sickly yellow instead of purple. These spikes are also made up of crystalized venom, but in the Shrouded Nerscylla's case, this is a special paralytic compound unique to this subspecies. These spikes can easily paralyze foes, as the venom they consist of is highly concentrated.[6]",
        "behavior": "Shrouded Nerscylla mostly inhabit the Dunes and are generally considered desert-dwellers. Their hunting strategy differs quite drastically from the common species: Shrouded Nerscylla do not built trap webs (although they do possess the ability to produce webbing) but instead dig into the sand, lying in wait until suitable prey walks by. When such an opportunity presents itself, they emerge with their chelicerae extended, snapping together violently in an attempt to kill their target in one bite.[7] They can also use their hooked pedipalps to gut and skin prey with ease.[8]\nShrouded Nerscylla are born in desert regions, but cannot reach maturity there, as the monsters they need to skin - namely Khezu - do not live in those climates. In order to grow into a state in which they can survive the desert sun and to find secure sources of food, juvenile Shrouded Nerscylla build small sails from their webbing in order to catch the winds that whip across the arid wastes, letting themselves be carried away into new lands. Their goal is to land in cavernous areas such as the Sunken Hollow, where they can feast on the rotten carcasses left behind by large cave predators. Shrouded Nerscylla that survive long enough to successfully skin a Khezu can then return to the deserts they were born in, reigning over them and eventually laying eggs there themselves, thus starting this cycle anew.[5]",

Rachnoid spit fire, capture prey, and support the Rakna-Kadaki's massive body. As their numbers dwindle, the beast will hatch more, at which point it is extremely dangerous. It moves quickly by tethering webs to its offspring, but a strike timed well enough to sever these threads will cause the Rakna-Kadaki to lose its balance and provide you an opening. If, however, you become entangled in its web and roasted by its flames, expect to take a significant amount of damage.\nThreat Level: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Rakna-Kadaki fights utilizing her extendable claws, producing string from her mouth to bind her targets and by firing out blasts of fire, either from her mouth or her sides. If a hunter is hit with a fire attack while Webbed, they will be stunned for a brief amount of time, becoming unable to break out of the webbing.\nRakna-Kadaki starts the fight with 5 Rachnoid on her abdomen. These Rachnoid can be thrown out attached to string, pulling the Rakna-Kadaki behind them. Attacking the string will sever it and topple the Rakna. Rachnoid can also be thrown out to perform attacks: either firing off webbing or a stream of fire when the Rakna is enraged. Damaging the Rachnoids enough will cause them to flee. Rachnoids will also flee if two of Rakna-Kadaki\u2019s legs are broken, which will also cause her remaining legs to break and briefly topple her.\nAfter all her Rachnoids flee, Rakna-Kadaki will proceed to create a brood sac over her abdomen, causing her abdomen to deal more damage and the cost of it receiving more damage. Eventually, Rakna-Kadaki will release a burst of flame around her, destroying her brood sac. The brood sac can also be destroyed with enough damage, toppling her. Either way, when the brood sac is destroyed, Rakna-Kadaki will regain her 5 Rachnoids and reform the string on her legs.",
